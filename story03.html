May 25, 2012 Mass Niche Market<br><br>
To the Publishers and Editors of Berkshire Hathaway's Daily Newspapers / Roban 2012-10-22<br><br>
Until recently, Berkshire has owned only one daily newspaper, The Buffalo News (the state of New York), purchased in 1977. In a month or so, we will own 26 dailies.<br><br>
I've loved newspapers all of my life ― and always will. My dad, when attending the University of Nebraska, was editor of The Daily Nebraskan. (I have copies of the papers he edited in 1924.) He met my mother when she applied for a job as a reporter at the paper. Her father owned a small paper in West Point, Neb., and my mother worked at various jobs at the paper in her teens, even mastering the operation of a linotype machine. From as early as I can remember, my two sisters and I devoured the contents of the World-Herald that my father brought home every night.<br><br>
In Washington, D.C., I delivered about 500,000 papers over a four-year period for the Post, Times-Herald and Evening Star. While in college at Lincoln, I worked 15 hours a week in country circulation for the Lincoln Journal (earning all of 75 cents an hour). Today, I read five newspapers daily. Call me an addict.<br><br>
Berkshire buys for keeps. Our only exception to permanent ownership is when a business faces unending losses, a remote prospect for virtually all of our dailies. So let me express a few thoughts about what lies ahead as we join forces.<br><br>
Though the economics of the business have drastically changed since our purchase of The Buffalo News, I believe newspapers that intensively cover their communities will have a good future. It's your job to make your paper indispensable to anyone who cares about what is going on in your city or town.<br><br>
That will mean both maintaining your news hole ― a newspaper that reduces its coverage of the news important to its community is certain to reduce its readership as well ― and thoroughly covering all aspects of area life, particularly local sports. No one has ever stopped reading halfway through a story that was about them or their neighbors.<br><br>
You should treat public policy issues just as you have in the past. I have some strong political views, but Berkshire owns the paper ― I don't. And Berkshire will always be nonpolitical. We have more than 600,000 shareholders of all stripes and I do not use Berkshire's resources, directly or indirectly, to speak for them. I am 81, and many of you will outlive me as an employee of Berkshire. But I am sure my successors will follow the ideas I am laying out in this letter. (Indeed, letting them know of this hands-off principle is a secondary reason for my writing this letter.)<br><br>
Your paper will operate from a position of financial strength. Berkshire will always maintain capital and liquidity second to none. We shun levels of debt that could ever impose problems. Therefore, you will determine your paper's destiny; outsiders will never dictate it.<br><br>
Our newspaper purchases are of smaller size, measured by dollar cost, than the businesses we normally consider buying. Nor will they move the needle in terms of Berkshire's economic value, though I expect their contribution will likely be commensurate with our investment. But the papers are every bit as important to me ― and, for that matter, to society ― as other businesses we have purchased for many billions of dollars.<br><br>
Terry Kroeger, at The Omaha World-Herald, will oversee our newspaper operations (excluding Buffalo). Like you and me, he knows that our future depends on remaining the primary source of information in certain subjects of great importance to our readers. Technological change has caused us to lose primacy in various key areas, including national news, national sports, stock quotations and employment opportunities. So be it. Our job is to reign supreme in matters of local importance.<br><br>
We must rethink the industry's initial response to the Internet. The original instinct of newspapers then was to offer free in digital form what they were charging for in print. This is an unsustainable model and certain of our papers are already making progress in moving to something that makes more sense. We want your best thinking as we work out the blend of digital and print that will attract both the audience and the revenue we need.<br><br>
Berkshire will probably purchase more papers in the next few years. We will favor towns and cities with a strong sense of community, comparable to the 26 in which we will soon operate. If a citizenry cares little about its community, it will eventually care little about its newspaper. In a very general way, strong interest in community affairs varies inversely with population size and directly with the number of years a community's population has been in residence. Therefore, we will focus on small and mid-sized papers in long-established communities.<br><br>
I hope you can come to our annual meeting next year. We had a newspaper-throwing contest at this year's meeting, and my competition was weak. You will dramatically upgrade the field, and I look forward to taking you on. You will also get a chance to hear my partner, Charlie Munger, and me tell an audience of 35,000 or so why we still love newspapers.<br><br>
Times are certainly far tougher today than they used to be for newspapers. Circulation nationally will continue to slip and in some cases plunge. But American papers have only failed when one or more of the following factors was present: (1) The town or city had two or more competing dailies; (2) the paper lost its position as the primary source of information important to its readers; or (3) the town or city did not have a pervasive self-identity. We don't face these problems.<br><br>
Indeed, the papers we own and are buying have been successful on both the journalistic and business fronts. They have earned the time, money and respect that subscribers allot them. I'm confident your paper will continue to do so.
I look forward to our future together.   Sincerely, Warren E. Buffett/ Morrogh, Information Architecture

小报大亨媒体集团<br><br>

巴菲特麾下的伯克希尔哈撒韦媒体集团，正在装下他这一年来在报纸行业大举扫货的战利品。<br><br>

2011年底，巴菲特囊中还只有三份报纸――持股长达40年、占股23%的《华盛顿邮报》，1977年买入的《布法罗新闻报》以及2011年末才买入的《奥马哈世界先驱报》。<br><br>

不到半年后，巴菲特又相继以1.42亿美元收购了Media General旗下63份报纸，并增持连锁报业Lee公司股份至20%。<br><br>

2012年6月，巴菲特又宣称要买下得克萨斯Bryan-College Station Eagle，这家报纸有123年的历史，而发行量只有2万份。<br><br>

这的确像一个怪诞行为――过去六年，即使算上数字版广告，报业的广告收入已经下跌一半。全球整个报纸行业的收入，甚至不抵Google一家互联网公司的收入。<br><br>

巴菲特是个狂热的报纸发烧友。他的父亲曾经是报纸编辑，母亲出身办报世家，而他自己的原始资本来自上学期间递送的50万份报纸。他曾经亲自提供线索给他收购的报纸《奥马哈太阳报》，而报道最终获得新闻界最高荣誉普利策奖。<br><br>

直至今日，他仍坚持每天读五份报纸――《华尔街日报》、《金融时报》、《纽约时报》、《今日美国》以及《奥马哈世界先驱报》。<br><br>为了在非洲旅行时能读到《华尔街日报》，他甚至不惜斥资让飞机空运。<br><br>
如果你写的是读者他自己和他邻居的故事，没有人会终止阅读。<br><br>
“技术变革使报纸在很多关键领域丧失地位，比如国内新闻、国内体育、股票行情和就业信息。那就让它们去。我们的任务是主宰地方性的重要内容。”巴菲特在给出版商和编辑的信中写道，“你们要完全覆盖地区生活的每个方面，尤其是当地的体育赛事。如果你写的是读者他自己和他邻居的故事，没有人会终止阅读。”<br><br>

“你们应该像过去一样对待公共政策的议题。我拥有强烈的政治观点，但是伯克希尔拥有报纸――而我并不拥有。”他继而写道，“我确保，我的继任者会继续遵循我在这封信里提到的‘不插手’原则。”<br><br>

对很多人来说，这更像是个价值投资者失去理智的笑话。<br><br>
Facebook上已经满是球赛的照片和故事<br><br>
“你真的要一个初出茅庐的新闻记者去报道高中球赛，当他记完笔记发完照片，发现Facebook上已经满是球赛的照片和故事了？”有人调侃称。<br><br>

“这种错误并不意味着伯克希尔一定会亏损。考虑到这些报纸是以跳楼价买到的，如果巴菲特收购的任何一家报纸在未来十年倒闭，巴菲特仍然可以从利息和报纸拥有的房地产上获利。”纽约大学教授Clay Shirky说。<br><br>

这很像半个世纪多前，巴菲特从老师本杰明格雷厄姆那里学到的。这位颇有些悲观主义的“证券分析之父”曾于1932年在《福布斯》发表文章称，看待企业时更多考虑的是倒闭价值而非存活价值。大多数都按照公司已经倒闭，即关门并被清算时的价值来思考一只股票的价值。<br><br>

不管是出于感性还是理性的考虑，巴菲特显然自有打算。“我们会继续买下更多的地方媒体。”他青睐那些有很强社区意识、中小规模以及具有长久历史的社区报纸。<br><br>
揭发奥马哈男孩城<br><br>
伯克希尔在1969年，从利普席手中，买下奥马哈当地的太阳报公司，这是巴菲特投资的第一家报社，巴菲特在旗下众多的媒体事业中，所扮演的几乎只是全然投注于企业经营面的角色，但是至少有一次，他对编辑台产生了重大的影响，他在揭发奥马哈男孩城的丑闻事件中，扮演着关键性的角色。<br><br>

　　1917年，一位瘦瘦高高的爱尔兰天主教神父法兰纳根，花了九十美元租下了一栋位于奥马哈的维多利亚式房子，他在这栋有穿堂风的房子里，收容了五个无家可归的男孩，这个流浪者之家扩充的很快，这个机构不但在强而有力的领导之下茁壮成长，而且也成为一个强势的金融中心，他帮助了孤苦无依的孩子，但是如果他能好好经营用捐款所构成的庞大投资组合，就可以帮助更多的孩子。<br><br>

　　巴菲特在1972年，接受当时担任华尔街日报记者的梁访问，这篇报导迟至1977年才刊出，我知道国税局规定慈善基金会必须公布他们的财务状况，于是我请编辑找出男孩城的档案，在筹资成立公司之际我就听说过很多关于男孩城的传言，说他们拥有大批股票，但是当我实际发现，这个经常喊穷，照顾不到七百名孩童的机构，累积的资产竟然超过二亿美元时，我还是吓得张口结舌。<br><br>

　　水牛城新闻报的发行人在写给作者的信中写到U<br><br>

　　男孩城的故事灵感来自于巴菲特，巴菲特、太阳报编辑威廉斯和我，经常在巴菲特家脑力激荡，讨论如何为太阳报写一篇调查、或企业性质的报导，做为一份周刊，我们无法和日报与电视媒体抢号外，所以我们必须为公司写出自己的东西。<br><br>

　　在一次聚会里，巴菲特提到男孩城的事，于是威廉斯和我就开始研究这个题目，保罗是整个调查小组的领导人与组织人，他和我一起计划调查策略、访问时机，并共同研究收集来的资料。<br><br>

　　后来，一篇不错的报导终于有了雏形，但是还不够精彩，巴菲特是关键人物，因为是他告诉我们国税局990表格上新增了一条规定，因为国会刚刚通过一项法案，规定所有基金会必须公开资产，当我们从华盛顿调来男孩城的990表格时，发现这份长达一百页的报告显示，他们持股总值高达二亿一千九百万美元，我用脑力激荡的方式起草报导内容，并且反复检阅写出来的东西，然后再由威廉斯加以发挥，为了不让消息外泄，当调查进行到最后阶段时，我们让四位记者带着电话、桌子和录音机，进驻威廉斯家的地下室。<br><br>

　　没有巴菲特，就没有这篇报导，更没有普立兹奖，这件事由他提起，990表格也是他告诉我们的，然后再由他分析总共价值二亿一千九百万美元的资产。<br><br>
地方特别报导项目赢得普立兹奖，这篇报导在1973年，在地方特别报导项目赢得普立兹奖，巴菲特在1981年卖掉太阳报，该报于1983年停刊。<br><br>

　　麦斯威尔当年曾是该报的送报生，现在是位于奥马哈的席尔实验室的药品业务代表，他回忆早期为该报工作的情形，我送报送了五年，对一份卖十五每分的报纸来说，我的薪水算是不少，我记得每送一份报纸我可以得到五美分，然后他又补充，我只后悔当初没把存下来的钱放到伯克希尔，时至今日，太阳报已经停刊，而男孩城借着多年来建立起的良好声誉，继续帮助上千名年轻孩子。<br><br>

　　巴菲特对梁透露，他为什么觉得报纸比其它企业有趣，我们不得不承认，报纸比其它行业，例如，制造火车车钩，要有趣多了，我绝对不干涉我报社的编辑工作，只是以身为这个具有教育社会功能机构中的一份子为荣。

Jeff Bezos on Post purchase<br><br>

     “You’ll have heard the news, and many of you will greet it with a degree of apprehension.” <br><br>

― Jeff Bezos, new owner of the Washington Post, in a letter to Post employees.<br><br>

 



By Jeff Bezos, Published: August 6<br><br>

To the employees of The Washington Post:<br><br>

You’ll have heard the news, and many of you will greet it with a degree of apprehension. When a single family owns a company for many decades, and when that family acts for all those decades in good faith, in a principled manner, in good times and in rough times, as stewards of important values C when that family has done such a good job C it is only natural to worry about change.<br><br>




So, let me start with something critical. The values of The Post do not need changing. The paper’s duty will remain to its readers and not to the private interests of its owners. We will continue to follow the truth wherever it leads, and we’ll work hard not to make mistakes. When we do, we will own up to them quickly and completely.<br><br>

I won’t be leading The Washington Post day-to-day. I am happily living in “the other Washington” where I have a day job that I love. Besides that, The Post already has an excellent leadership team that knows much more about the news business than I do, and I’m extremely grateful to them for agreeing to stay on.
<br><br>
There will, of course, be change at The Post over the coming years. That’s essential and would have happened with or without new ownership. The Internet is transforming almost every element of the news business: shortening news cycles, eroding long-reliable revenue sources, and enabling new kinds of competition, some of which bear little or no news-gathering costs. There is no map, and charting a path ahead will not be easy. We will need to invent, which means we will need to experiment. Our touchstone will be readers, understanding what they care about C government, local leaders, restaurant openings, scout troops, businesses, charities, governors, sports C and working backwards from there. I’m excited and optimistic about the opportunity for invention.<br><br>

Journalism plays a critical role in a free society, and The Washington Post -- as the hometown paper of the capital city of the United States -- is especially important. I would highlight two kinds of courage the Grahams have shown as owners that I hope to channel. The first is the courage to say wait, be sure, slow down, get another source. Real people and their reputations, livelihoods and families are at stake. The second is the courage to say follow the story, no matter the cost. While I hope no one ever threatens to put one of my body parts through a wringer, if they do, thanks to Mrs. Graham’s example, I’ll be ready.<br><br>

I want to say one last thing that’s really not about the paper or this change in ownership. I have had the great pleasure of getting to know Don very well over the last ten plus years. I do not know a finer man.<br><br>

Sincerely,<br><br>

Jeff Bezos<br><br>

	<b><a name="T3">Open letter to Jeff Bezos</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
	By Gene Weingarten,August 06, 2013<br><br>
 
Dear Jeff,<br><br>

Welcome to The Post. I have read that the $250 million you paid for this newspaper is roughly 1 percent of your net worth, making it about as risky and consequential a purchase for you as a used 2003 Honda Civic might be for me. Still, I hope and strongly suspect you will not see it as a plaything, or, to extend the already shaky metaphor, a vehicle for promoting your bigger enterprises. I am presuming that despite the chump-change numbers, this is a big deal for you, and that you plan to roll up your sleeves and be the guy who finds a way to make conventional journalism succeed financially. I’d like to offer some advice.<br><br>

Back in 1982, when I was an editor at Tropic, the Miami Herald’s Sunday magazine, the publisher asked us to run a story on our cover about the winners of The Silver Knight award, which was given out every year at a gala to the most promising high school seniors in the Miami area. The Silver Knights were a fine and noble enterprise, but the event was run and financed by Knight-Ridder, the corporate owners of The Miami Herald; Herald stories about the Silver Knight awards were inevitably uncritical, nakedly celebratory, and drenched in self-promotion. We at Tropic declined to run the story of the awards on the grounds that we were a small magazine trying to establish a feisty, pugnacious identity, and being a corporate suckup toady lickspittle didn’t fit in with our plans. The publisher glowered, muttered something about insubordination, and steered the story to another, less visible section of the paper. We went unpunished.<br><br>


Wikipedia tells me that one of the Silver Knight winners that year was little Jeffrey Bezos of Miami Palmetto High School. Haha.<br><br>

You and I briefly crossed paths as younger men, and I dissed you. I guess it’s clear who won that race.<br><br>

Here’s the thing: We were right to decline that story, Jeff, but, more to the point, our publisher was wise to LET us decline. In the next 10 years, freed to robustly experiment with an outsize personality, Tropic would develop a fanatic following in Miami, and our writers and photographers would win two Pulitzers and be finalists for two more. That happened because the people above us trusted us, if grudgingly, and -- more important -- had our backs.<br><br>

I was telling this tale of tolerated impertinence to Howard Simons, the brilliant newspaper editor at the Washington Post, shortly before he died of cancer in 1990. He smiled and said that it embodied his most important principle as a newspaper manager: “Kick up, kiss down.” Aggravate your bosses, but make the people below you love and respect you. Katharine Graham and Don Graham were brilliant at this -- they must have given their board of directors fits, because during the great years they chose aggressive journalism over pennypinching every time -- and we loved them for it. It’s an irreplaceable advantage, loyalty drawn from affection and respect.<br><br>

My father once told me that he felt grief-stricken at the sudden death of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1945, but not fear that the country was now in the hands of some obscure haberdasher named Truman. My father knew only one thing about Truman, really -- that in failing health, and in the middle of a world war, F.D.R. had chosen him, and so Truman must be a good man. That was enough for my father.<br><br>



I think I speak for more than myself when I say that the main reason I have high hopes for your stewardship is that Don Graham said it was the right thing for the paper. He said you are the right guy. That was enough for me.<br><br>

“Great” is an overused term, and sports has rendered it almost meaningless, so I won’t say you have just bought a “great” newspaper. I’m not even sure you’ve bought a “newspaper” in any understood sense. You have bought a place filled with enormously talented and dedicated journalists who are, at the moment, terrified at the prospect of change we don’t really understand. We’ve already lost some fine people to that terror.<br><br>

You are obviously a good businessman, and you are said to be a visionary. I hope you have a clear vision of where to take this remarkable enterprise. As you go there, please remember to kick up, and kiss down.<br><br>

And sorry about the Silver Knight. But we were right.<br><br>

	Jeff Bezos and the Washington Post C a culture war<br><br>

Jeff Bezos buys himself the The Washington Post. Necrophilia or the beginning of another transformation of an old genre?<br><br>
 


Jean-Louis Gassee <br><br>

theguardian.com, Monday 12 August <br><br>



Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has an estimated fortune of more than $25bn, putting him in the top 20 richest people in the world. Photograph: Composite<br><br>


A successful business man reaches the dangerous age of 50, looks at his fortune and makes a decision: He's going to plough a few of his millions into a restaurant. In the past 25 years, he's been to many of the best dining places around the world. Power lunches, closing dinners, gastronomy road trips with the family, he's done it all.<br><br>

He knows restaurants.<br><br>

But he keeps failing. He fires the chef, changes suppliers, hires a new dining room manager, looks for a classier sommelier, fights city inspectors, calls on his acquaintances and asks them to bring their celebrity friends … nothing works.<br><br>

He was blinded by his command of his true calling: being a customer. He saw the show from a comfortable box seat and only went backstage when invited by a knowing proprietor eager to glad-hand a moneyed patron. Our gastronome failed to see he knew very little about being a restaurateur, the intricacies, the people challenges (theft, drugs and sex), the politics that are involved in running a real restaurant.<br><br>

(During my psychosocial moratorium, before I joined the high-tech industry in 1968, I worked in a bar, a food-serving strip-joint, and a restaurant. I thought these places were deranged. Decades later, I read Anthony Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential and realized the "people challenges" I witnessed aren't so unusual after all. Enjoy the book and think about the goings-on back there next time a maitre d' looks down his aquiline nose at you.)<br><br>

Failed restaurants are common in Silicon Valley, with its crowd of affluent and well-traveled business people who think they can master the trade. A few of them subsidise the great dinners we get to enjoy C for a while. They have our fleeting gratitude and end up with a painfully depleted bank account.<br><br>

Is this a valid parable for Jeff Bezos plowing $250M (so far) into The Washington Post? To start, the price paid for the DC "paper of record" amounts to less than 1% of the Amazon founder's fortune. Even if he has to double or triple his initial investment while he turns the paper around, it won't trouble Bezos' pocketbook much C he can eminently afford the bet.<br><br>

And, unlike our failed restaurateur, I don't think Bezos' purchase was made in a mid-life fit of vanity. (Although see this delicious piece of Internet satire that contends he bought the paper as a result of a mistaken click.) Read Bezos' Wikipedia bio, or his letters to shareholders … you'll see he's a deep-thinking geek (now a term of respect. The Urban Dictionary updates the meaning: people you pick on in high school and wind up working for as an adult). He's justifiably famous for taking the very long view, and he's quotably willing to be "misunderstood" for a long time.<br><br>

But can he win?<br><br>

Personally, I hope so. I used to love newspapers, I remember how much I enjoyed breakfast with two local and two national papers, all delivered to my doorstep, an unimaginable luxury in France.<br><br>

Once upon a time, for their advertising revenue, newpapers enjoyed an oligopoly. With three or four dailies in each market, prices were contained. And we, the readers, certainly didn't mind that advertisers paid 75% of the cost of our daily fix.<br><br>

Then, the internet that Bezos has ridden so well intervened and newspapers lost the news race. The internet won on velocity and, too often, on relevance. In a Fortune Tech piece offering "5 hacks for Jeff Bezos", Ryan Holmes, CEO of Social Media Management company HootSuite, points to the speed and tone of social media as sources of fixes for the Post:<br><br>


Perhaps the greatest criticism of newspapers today is that they have lost relevance to their own readers. Writing on the decline of the Post, New York Times media columnist David Carr points out that "[the] days when people snapped open the daily paper to find out the things they should care about were long past ..." Big newspapers, in particular, have proven startlingly inept at delivering timely, relevant news to the people they serve. So, naturally, readers have gone elsewhere, to myriad online sources that better cater to their interests.<br><br>

Since the net offered a seemingly unconstrained amount of billboard space, the price that newspapers could charge for ads was quickly cut by a factor of 10 and, more recently, 16.<br><br>

But it wasn't just the emergence of the internet as a news medium that dealt newspapers a near fatal blow. They also lost the race because of internal, cultural circumstances.<br><br>

In another case of the Incumbent's Curse, newspapers looked down on the internet and those annoying high-tech people and things. Kara Swisher, co-head of AllThingsD (a Wall Street Journal enterprise), recounts her trouble with the old, arrogant culture at the Post in her Dear Jeff Bezos, Here's What I Saw as an Analog Nobody in the Mailroom of the Washington Post letter:<br><br>


"It happened every day C other reporters playfully mocking me for using email so much or for borrowing the Post's few suitcase cellphones, or major editors telling me that the internet was like the CB-radio fad, or sales people insisting that the good times would never end for newspapers as long as there were local businesses that needed to reach consumers. (In truth, they still do, but that's another letter.)"<br><br>

Sadly, the Post's cultural reluctance isn't unique. In another country, two prominent dailies I know exhibit very similar symptoms, print journalists who actively despise or even obstruct the internet side of their house.<br><br>

Much has been written about Jeff Bezos' personal (not Amazon's) purchase of the Post. For example: Good Luck With That C Pew Research Graphs Bezos' Stunning Challenge, where Tom Foremski steps us through the Post's business challenges, starting with the inexorable decline in print revenues:<br><br>
Another comment well worth reading, Stop the Presses: A New Media Baron Appears, comes to us courtesy of Michael Moritz, aka Sir Michael, a journalist who went over to the Dark Side and is now chairman of Sequoia Capital, a leading venture firm. The article reminds us of Bezos' foremost preoccupation with customers [emphasis mine]:<br><br>


"It won't come as a surprise that Bezos explains that pleasing, if not thrilling, customers is Amazon's most important task. In his 2009 letter he provided a peek into the internals of Amazon, explaining that of the company's 452 detailed goals for the ensuing year 360 had an impact on the customer, the word 'revenue' was used just eight times, 'free cash flow' only four times and 'net income', 'gross profit', 'margin' and operating profit were not mentioned. Even though there is no line item on any financial statement for the intangible value associated with the trust of customers this is, by far and away, Amazon's most important asset."<br><br>

Elsewhere, Moritz reminds us of another source of Amazon's prosperity, Free Cash-Flow, a frequent topic in Bezos' letters to shareholders:<br><br>


"Since inception Amazon has generated $20.2bn (GBP13bn) from operations almost half of which ($8.6bn), has been used for capital expenditures such as new distribution centres, which improve life for the customer."<br><br>

With this and more in mind, we now turn to the letter Bezos wrote to employees at the newspaper. While he professes no desire to "be leading the Washington Post day-to-day", he nonetheless makes no mystery of his goal to be an agent of change, of modernisation, of adapting to the internet age:<br><br>


"There will, of course, be change at the Post over the coming years. That's essential and would have happened with or without new ownership. The internet is transforming almost every element of the news business: shortening news cycles, eroding long-reliable revenue sources, and enabling new kinds of competition, some of which bear little or no news-gathering costs. There is no map, and charting a path ahead will not be easy. We will need to invent, which means we will need to experiment. Our touchstone will be readers, understanding what they care about C government, local leaders, restaurant openings, scout troops, businesses, charities, governors, sports C and working backwards from there. I'm excited and optimistic about the opportunity for invention."
<br><br>
This comes from a man who, last year, said 'People Won't Pay for News on the Web, Print will be Dead in 20 Years'.
<br><br>
Changing business models as a publicly traded company is impossible in practice. The old model dies faster than the new one kicks in and Wall Street runs away from the transition's "earnings trough". By buying the Washington Post, Bezos is afforded a privacy that the old public ownership structure doesn't permit. (That's exactly why Michael Dell wants to take his own company private, so he can perform surgery behind the curtains.)<br><br>

Which leaves the new owner with his biggest challenge: Understanding and changing the culture at the old "paper" C which sounds harder and more expensive than a gastronome trying to become a restaurateur.<br><br>

There will be blood.

This is no reflection on Bezos' truly amazing diversity and depth of skills, but a sincere concern borne of culture's ability to devour anything that stands in its way, sometimes silently until it's too late. As the saying goes: culture eats strategy for breakfast.<br><br>

Of course, we have examples of people performing seemingly impossible feats. Steve Jobs' Apple 2.0 comes to mind, a turnaround of monumental proportions to which Bezos' Amazon achievements could be fairly compared. So, why couldn't Bezos build a WaPo 2.0?<br><br>

As Aaron Levie, the founding CEO of Box, tweeted last week:<br><br>


"Industries are transformed by outsiders who think anything is possible, not insiders who think they already know what is impossible."
<br><br>
One more thing, a thought I can't suppress: Unlike Jobs, who gained insight from his tribulations and then spread the benefits on the largest of scales, Bezos hasn't been burned and tempered by failure.<br><br>


Jeff Bezos: Washington Post sale leaves some anxiety over mogul's motives<br><br>

Newsroom described as optimistic the day after the paper's sale as most believe Amazon founder brings needed expertise Dan Roberts in Washington <br><br>

The Guardian, Wednesday 7 August 2013
<br><br>
Bezos has also left some mild anxiety among journalists at the paper who remain uncertain of his long-term motives. 
<br><br>
The US media world was coming to terms on Tuesday with the shock sale of the Washington Post to the founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, who bought the venerable paper for a fraction of his personal fortune.<br><br>

With a mixture of sentiment and apprehension, journalists at the Post appeared resigned to the $250m sale by the Graham family, which had owned the flagship title since 1933. The stock market reacted with delight: shares in the Washington Post company leapt to highs not seen since 2008.<br><br>

"Jeff Bezos seems to me exactly the kind of inventive and innovative choice needed to bring about a recommitment to great journalism," said Carl Bernstein, whose co-reporting of the Watergate scandal that brought down President Richard Nixon in the 1970s defined the paper.<br><br>

Though Bezos, who is buying the Post with $250m of his own money, is thought unlikely to interfere editorially, he has also left some anxiety among journalists at the paper who remain uncertain of his long-term motives.
<br><br>
Columnist Gene Weingarten published an open letter on the Post's website calling on its new owner to respect its editorial boundaries and resist the temptation to interfere in ways other corporate owners of newspapers have done. "You are obviously a good businessman, and you are said to be a visionary. I hope you have a clear vision of where to take this remarkable enterprise," he said.<br><br>

Monday's announcement of the sale took Washington completely by surprise. Few knew of it in advance: the journalist who wrote the story revealing the sale said he was sworn to secrecy since being told about it on Sunday.<br><br>

David Graham, the senior Graham family member on the board, told staff that while it was a difficult decision for the family, it was the inevitable one if the Post was to survive. "I never until this year even imagined the possibility that we might think about selling," he told the Post's economics blogger, Ezra Klein. But revenue prospects looked bleak: "2013 we knew was probably going to be the seventh year in a row of declining revenues and particularly declining print advertising revenues," he said. <br><br>

In discussions with his niece, Katharine Graham, publisher of the Post, they entertained the idea of a sale to a private buyer in order to prevent another round of cuts. "For the first time in either of our lives we asked ourselves if we thought our small public company was still the best place for the newspaper," he said.<br><br>

But not everyone in Washington regards the Grahams as the largely benevolent custodians of newspaper independence that DC folklore maintains. Damon Silvers, policy director of union umbrella group the AFL-CIO, pointed out that the family owners have be an integral part of the Washington establishment for decades, and that the transfer of ownership would not change much. <br><br>

"I am not sure that anything significant has changed here in terms of ideology," he said. "The Grahams used the paper as a instrument of influence peddling too in that their main aim was to court power."<br><br>

Union activists were also wary of Amazon's chequered history of labour relations, claiming it taken an aggressive stance against attempts to organise workers in its vast distribution centres. The Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild which represents many of the Post's non-management staff, issued a non-committal statement calling on Bezos to complete current pay negotiations.<br><br>

Elsewhere, the growing power of Amazon as a lynchpin not just of the book trade, but much of the retail and cloud computing industries, raised concerns that Bezos is consolidating a commercial dominance that will be hard to counter.<br><br>

"One of the questions this raises is whether we are going back to the old model of people primarily owning papers for influence," said Kathy Kiely of the Sunlight Foundation. "The newspaper business briefly became attractive for people who wanted to invest to make money but the changes brought by technology are taking us back to a point where the tycoons and barons of the post-industrial age are buying newspapers because they are status symbols."<br><br>

Campaign finance data gathered by the Center for Responsive Politics shows the new owner of Washington's hometown paper has hitherto spent little of his personal fortune on political donations C giving just $162,000 altogether to federal political candidates or committees since 1998.<br><br>

But Kiely said the Sunlight Foundation had tracked a growing amount spent by Amazon and Silicon Valley on lobbying, raising suspicion that the new breed of technology publishers are buying newspapers for influence as much as money.
<br><br>
"For someone with his amount of cash flow he has got a relatively low political profile at this point but this certainly gives him a bully pulpit and this looks to be an investment that is more about power than money," Kiely said.<br><br>

Inside the Post newsroom, journalists were said to be sanguine about the decision by the Graham family to sell their stake in the paper, believing that Bezos offers deeper pockets and much-needed internet expertise as it struggles with falling print revenues.<br><br>

"At this stage, people are pretty optimistic but no one really knows that much about why he is doing this," said one senior editor speaking to the Guardian anonymously on Tuesday.<br><br>

"We hope he is civic-minded and will give us the resources to perform our democratic role, but that is a starry-eyed vision, and he could equally be buying the paper as a vanity project C we just don't know."<br><br>

In that sense, Bezos is is different from many past newspaper tycoons who straddled multiple industries, and the new owner stressed continuity in his brief public statement on the deal. "I understand the critical role the Post plays in Washington DC and our nation, and the Post's values will not change," Bezos said.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T5">Bezos and the Washington Post: A Skeptical View</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
August 6, 2013<br><br>


Posted by John Cassidy<br><br>

The first and only time I’ve seen Jeff Bezos up close was in 2004, at the White House Correspondents’ dinner. If I remember correctly, and I think I do, he was being led into the Vanity Fair-Bloomberg after-party by Roxanne Roberts, a longtime writer for the Washington Post’s Style section. A skinny, balding, fidgety fellow, he seemed a bit out of place in a black tie and a tux, smiling awkwardly as he shook hands and chatted with the capital’s power brokers and visiting celebrities.<br><br>


Now, as the new owner of the Post, as well as the chief executive of Amazon, Bezos is Roberts’s boss and a formidable power broker in his own right. Many journalists currently or formerly associated with the Post are saying nice things about him. Appearing on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Tuesday, Bob Woodward said, “This isn’t Rupert Murdoch buying the Wall Street Journal, this is somebody who believes in the values that the Post has been prominent in practicing, and so I don’t see any downside.” In a statement, Carl Bernstein, Woodward’s former partner, described Bezos as “exactly the kind of inventive and innovative choice needed to bring about a recommitment to great journalism on the scale many of us have been hoping for.” Fred Hiatt, the paper’s editorial-page editor, said, “We’ve all been looking for a way to marry quality journalism with commercial success in the digital era, and it’s hard to think of anyone better positioned to figure that out than Jeff Bezos.” Ezra Klein, a columnist and the editor of Wonkblog, wrote, “For now, I’m hopeful.”
<br><br>
It’s all very well to be optimistic and hopeful that Bezos’s purchase of the Post is an essentially philanthropic project, or even a vanity one, and that, after years of cuts at the paper, he will invest the resources needed to restore it to its erstwhile glory. Along with James Fallows, who wrote about the purchase yesterday at the Atlantic, I would like to think that this marks “the beginning of a phase in which this Gilded Age’s major beneficiaries re-invest in the infrastructure of our public intelligence.” But am I convinced that that’s what’s happening? I am not.<br><br>

If Bezos’s motives are essentially philanthropic, why isn’t he purchasing the paper through his family foundation, which could probably afford it, especially if he kicked it some more of his estimated twenty-five billion dollars? At the moment, the family foundation, which is run by Bezos’s parents, Jackie and Mike, focusses on preschool and K-12 education. But there’s nothing to stop it from adding saving newspapers that educate the public to its list of aims. For years now, some knowledgeable media people have thought that the only long-term solution for America’s serious newspapers, which do costly, serious journalism, is to have their ultimate owners be charitable trusts, which is how the Guardian was structured until recently.<br><br>

Evidently, Bezos isn’t taking this route, which leaves two possibilities, not mutually exclusive. The first is he intends to return the Post to its former role as a profitable business, a project with which I wish him good luck. It is surely fanciful to suggest that Bezos, simply because of his experience at Amazon, will immediately come up with a fresh digital strategy to save the Post. If such a wheeze were readily available, somebody at a newspaper company would have thought of it. To be sure, the Post, like most newspapers, was slow to realize the full scale of the threat that it faced from online competitors. In recent years, though, it has invested in the Web, developing some popular and high-quality online products, such as Wonkblog and The Fix. But, so far, this push hasn’t much helped the paper’s bottom line. In the first half of this year, the Post lost about fifty million dollars, after accounting for pension costs.<br><br>

The second possibility is that Bezos is buying the Post for political reasons, a theory for which I have no evidence, except that it is neither outlandish nor ahistorical. It is a reason that people buy newspapers. On a personal level, Bezos is a socially progressive libertarian―a fairly common crossbreed in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street, the two arenas where he has spent his business career. Last year, he and his wife pledged $2.5 million to support gay marriage in a Washington State referendum, and the measure passed handily. Over the years, he has contributed modestly to candidates of both major parties, and, as David Remnick notes, to the nonprofit 501(c)(3) entity that owns the libertarian magazine Reason. <br><br>

Is Bezos is buying the Post to push a liberal / libertarian agenda―one of the few things in the world that could simultaneously delight Nancy Pelosi and Rand Paul? Somehow, I doubt it. A bit of a recluse, he doesn’t strike me as a political crusader or as someone who wants to be more of a public figure than he already is. If you own a big newspaper, you can’t avoid getting a good deal of attention. If you own a big newspaper and you also have a clear political agenda―like Hearst or Murdoch―you quickly become a lightning rod, and all that furor can cause problems for your other businesses.<br><br>

I’m pretty sure that’s the last thing Bezos would want. Having spent the past twenty years building Amazon into an online behemoth, he wouldn’t do anything that could harm it. Indeed, I have a nagging, if possibly unfounded, suspicion that his primary motivation in buying the Post is to protect Amazon’s interests in the political battle, which is sure to come, over the company’s monopolistic tendencies. Why do I suspect that? In part, because I am a skeptic. But also because it’s just about the only explanation that makes sense.<br><br>

For the past fifteen years, Internet companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook have been rightly lionized as triumphs of American entrepreneurship. As the Web matures, though, they are gradually coming to be viewed in a different light, as quasi-monopolies that need at least a modicum of oversight. Because of the presence of network effects and other sources of increasing returns to scale, there is a natural tendency for successful online companies to increase market share and, eventually, to dominate a specific market. Google dominates search and, through You Tube, it also dominates online video. Facebook dominates social networking and, through Instagram, it also has a big presence in microblogging. And Amazon dominates online retailing.<br><br>

Any monopoly position in the market comes with the capacity for abuse. And behind Bezos’s public image as a smiling geek there is a ruthless business strategist. In the book market, Amazon has followed the classic monopolist’s script of cutting prices to build up its market share and eliminate competition. Now that its competitors are struggling or gone, there is some evidence Amazon is raising prices, although the company denies this. In other areas, too, the online retailer has thrown its weight around like an old-fashioned monopolist. As Amazon expanded across the country, it has sought to avoid collecting and paying sales taxes on the goods that it sells, thus preserving an unfair price advantage over brick-and-mortar competitors. (For more on this, see the recent cover story in Fortune “AMAZON’S (NOT SO SECRET) WAR ON TAXES.”)<br><br>

At this stage, one of the main threats to the fortunes of companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook comes not from potential competitors but, rather, from the political authorities that are gradually awakening to their market power. Google’s search business has faced antitrust investigations in the United States and Europe. The Justice Department’s competition arm is moving to regulate Apple’s iTunes store. And Facebook and other online companies are facing questions about how they protect the privacy of their users.<br><br>

So far, Amazon has gotten off easy. Rather than investigating whether it was guilty of predatory pricing in the books market, the Justice Department brought suit against some of its competitors, like Apple, and old-line book publishers. But the political climate is changing. At the local level, states like California and Texas have demanded that Amazon pay sales taxes on the goods that it sells to state residents. (In Texas, Amazon responded by shutting down a Dallas distribution center and threatening to abandon the state.) And earlier this year in Washington, D.C., the Senate, with the support of the Obama Administration, passed a bill that would force online companies like Amazon to collect and pay state sales taxes even if they don’t have a physical presence there. The bill, known as the Marketplace Fairness Act, is currently in the House of Representatives, and its prospects are unclear. <br><br>

As the Fortune article makes clear, Bezos and his lobbyists in Washington have fought a long battle to protect the company’s cost advantage. Bezos now says that he supports the sales-tax legislation, and my guess is that he recognizes that he’s going to lose this one. In California and other states, Amazon has already reached a deal with local authorities to start collecting sales taxes. In anticipation of the new tax regime, it is building dozens of new distribution centers throughout the country, evidently in preparation for a push into selling and delivering produce and other food.<br><br>

This “local” strategy will bring Amazon into competition with many more retailers. It’s sure to cause controversy and spur demands to restrain the firm’s imperialistic tendencies. And when that happens, Bezos will be the proud owner of the newspaper that, even now, helps to set the agenda in the nation’s capital. <br><br>

Will he be ordering his editors to publish articles defending Amazon’s business tactics and criticizing those who question them? I very much doubt that, too. Such a tactic would be transparent, counterproductive, and, quite possibly, contrary to his belief in the First Amendment. But through the editorial columns of the Post, as well as through the ready access to powerful people that being the owner of the newspaper brings, he will be able to have his voice heard much more clearly. And that, surely, must be worth something to him. Two hundred and fifty million dollars, perhaps?<br><br>

Jeff Bezos 收购《华盛顿邮报》真的只是「点错了鼠标」么？ <br><br>
 


国际在线专稿：据《纽约客》8月6日报道，电子商务企业亚马逊公司创始人杰弗里贝索斯(Jeff Bezos)将支付2.5亿美元现金，已个人名义收购《华盛顿邮报》。就在各家媒体纷纷揣测贝索斯这一举动的背后意义时，贝索斯却表示收购这件事“太混乱了”，自己只是不小心点错了鼠标而已。<br><br>
　　报道称，贝索斯身家252亿美元，在美国《福布斯》富豪榜位列第19名。鉴于贝索斯曾引领图书进入数字时代，媒体纷纷猜测这次的收购能否帮助《华盛顿邮报》适应“新媒体”浪潮冲击。就在各家媒体还没回过神的时候，贝索斯于当地时间8月6日在接受媒体采访时无奈的表示，自己并没有购买意愿。<br><br>
　　贝索斯称：“我猜我当时可能正在浏览他们的网页，并没有注意到自己点了什么。我什么都不想买！”“我绝不可能购买《华盛顿邮报》，我都没读过它。”<br><br>
　　贝索斯表示，他的美国运通卡在6日上午收到了一笔2.5亿美元的付款通知。在咨询过信用卡公司后，他才知道自己需要花费2.5亿美元购买《华盛顿邮报》，贝索斯形容这“不是一般的疯狂”。<br><br>
　　贝索斯称自己给《华盛顿邮报》的客服打了电话，想解释这个误会，但是只收到了几句搪塞。“我一直在跟他们说我也不知道事情怎么会这样，我不想收购。但是事情好像没有转还的余地了。”<br><br>

这是个恶搞笑话，用来讽刺Amazon的1-Click Purchase的。<br><br>

“一键购买”是Amazon的专利技术，只要点一下按钮，立刻完成付款。文章讲的故事明显是模仿客户在Amazon上的购物体验 ---- 你见过哪个公司的网站上会有“收购本公司”的链接么？<br><br>

Posted by Andy Borowitz<br><br>

SEATTLE (The Borowitz Report)―Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, told reporters today that his reported purchase of the Washington Post was a “gigantic mix-up,” explaining that he had clicked on the newspaper by mistake.<br><br>

“I guess I was just kind of browsing through their website and not paying close attention to what I was doing,” he said. “No way did I intend to buy anything.”<br><br>

Mr. Bezos said he had been oblivious to his online shopping error until earlier today, when he saw an unusual charge for two hundred and fifty million dollars on his American Express statement.<br><br>



After investigating with the credit-card company, he was informed that he had been charged for the purchase price of the entire Washington Post, which, he said, was “pure craziness.”<br><br>

“No way in hell would I buy the Washington Post,” he said. “I don’t even read the Washington Post.”<br><br>

Mr. Bezos said he had been on the phone with the Post’s customer service for the better part of the day trying to unwind his mistaken purchase, but so far “they’ve really been giving me the runaround.”<br><br>

According to Mr. Bezos, “I keep telling them, I don’t know how it got in my cart. I don’t want it. It’s like they’re making it impossible to return it.”<br><br>

Entrepreneurs <br><br>
 
 8/08/2013 <br><br>
 

The following post was published on the Knowledge@Wharton Today blog on August 6, 2013.<br><br>

The sale on Monday of the 136-year-old Washington Postnewspaper for $250 million to Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos is the latest wake-up call for print publications amid the changing preferences of increasingly digitally savvy reader-consumers.<br><br>

Last Saturday, The New York Times Company announced that it plans to sell The Boston Globe and affiliated publications to commodities investor and Boston Red Sox owner John Henry for $70 million, a fraction of the $1.1 billion The New York Times Company paid to buy them in 1993. The same day, IBT Media bought Newsweek magazine for an undisclosed amount from media mogul Barry Diller’s IAC/InterActiveCorp. Sidney Harman, a philanthropist and founder of the Harman Kardon electronics company, had bought the magazine from The Washington Post Company in 2010 for the symbolic price of one dollar along with $47 million in debt before selling it to Diller.<br><br>

In April 2012, a group of business leaders including New Jersey insurance executive and Democratic Party fundraiser George Norcross III bought the company that owns The Philadelphia Inquirer and the Philadelphia Daily News for $55 million. A group of investors paid $515 million to buy the papers in 2006.
<br><br>
In a letter explaining the decision to sell the newspaper, Donald Graham, CEO of The Washington Post Company, said his family, which has owned the publication since 1933, was no longer the right group to run it. “We had innovated, and to my critical eye our innovations had been quite successful in audience and in quality, but they hadn’t made up for the revenue decline,” he wrote.<br><br>

Bezos, who grew Amazon from an online bookseller to an e-commerce behemoth, will have to find a way to reinvent the Post‘s business model and to enhance the reader experience, according to Wharton legal studies and business ethics professor Kevin Werbach.<br><br>

At Amazon, which had revenues of $61 billion last year, Bezos has been successful in “innovating around the business model and around the experience,” says Werbach. “Amazon beat bricks-and-mortar bookstores like Borders and Barnes & Noble by offering books more cheaply and with a much bigger inventory. The company took the most mundane aspect of e-commerce ― shipping fees ― and turned them into a huge competitive advantage [with promotions like the free "super saver" option and free two-day shipping for subscribers to Amazon Prime.] And then it innovated around the activity of buying books online, first by including reviews, then later with lists, recommendations, Kindle and more.”<br><br>

Werbach notes that newspapers like the Post face “a higher cost structure than alternatives.” But he does not expect Bezos to make severe cuts on the editorial side “because that would kill what makes the Post distinctive and valuable.” It’s also unlikely Bezos will completely get rid of the print product, Werbach adds, since there continues to be demand for one. But he does foresee Bezos seeking a broader national and international focus for the Post so it can better compete on the digital side with publications like The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.<br><br>

“No one in the newspaper business understands marketing and customer service the way the great technology companies like Amazon.com and Apple do,” Werbach says. “The relationship has to extend beyond receiving a paper on your doorstep each day and sending a check [to pay for the subscription] every few months. I do not know how Bezos and his team will achieve this, and I doubt he does, yet. We really have yet to see true experimentation in the newspaper business the way we have with other media industries, though, so the opportunity is great.”<br><br>

Such innovation is imperative in an age when there is “immense portability” of the reader, Raju Narisetti, a former managing editor of The Washington Post told Knowledge@Wharton in an interview last year. He added that the only way for newspapers to be competitive and build engagement and loyalty is to “take your great journalism and create an amazing experience around it.”<br><br>

In a K@W story about The Washington Post Company’s purchase of hospice services provider Celtic Healthcare published last October, Wharton management professor Daniel Raff pointed to Amazon as an example the Post could follow. “There are ways for newspapers to generate revenue that are not confined to [charging readers for access to the site],” Raff told Knowledge@Wharton at the time. “Amazon started out selling books and got itself in the position of being the most prominent address on the web.”<br><br>

Now, Bezos will own a “storied franchise” that has more to it than unearthing scandals like Watergate, Raff notes. The Graham family that ran it for the past 80 years made it “respectable” and “one of the principal ornaments of American journalism,” he adds. “That is the source of the brand equity.”<br><br>

Although Bezos is buying the Post in his personal capacity, he could also find synergies between the paper and Amazon, especially with regards to the Kindle e-readers and tablets, Raff says. For example, Bezos could use the Post‘s archives and current articles to create “a valuable platform” for nonfiction prose on matters of great public interest. The infrastructure of Kindle ownership could make that “a very interesting possibility.”<br><br>

Raff notes that Bezos has the skills to fill the gaps the Post’s owners leave behind. “Bezos is undoubtedly a brilliant man and an extremely wealthy man. He is certainly capable of making investments with a long time horizon and pursuing them imaginatively to give hope to a storied franchise like that of The Washington Post.”<br><br>


How will Amazon's Bezos change The Washington Post?<br><br>


By Bill Rigby<br><br>

  Aug 7, 2013  
<br><br>
(Reuters) - Technology and media circles are abuzz at how e-commerce wunderkind Jeff Bezos plans to modernize The Washington Post, a money-losing bastion of the old economy.<br><br>

Among the top predictions: the man who transformed retailing will want to wean the venerable paper off its print edition; expand the Post's real-time content for a Twitter generation; share Amazon's near-unparalleled data on online buyers; and devise novel avenues to sell anything from books to smartphones to the Post's half a million readers.<br><br>

The founder and CEO of Amazon.com Inc hasn't given much away since he struck a deal to buy the 135-year-old paper for $250 million. But he did tell employees on Monday that they will have to "invent" and "experiment" as the Internet revolutionizes the news business.<br><br>

Although Bezos, not Amazon, is buying the Post, it is widely expected that he will in some way 'Amazon-ify' the news business, bringing across strategies imprinted on the company he founded in a garage 19 years ago.<br><br>

One thing is clear: the famed innovator is bringing enormous street cred to bear on a problem that has baffled newspaper owners for over a decade: how to reverse the ebb of advertisers to other media.<br><br>

"Amazon realized information travels much faster as a digital object rather than a physical object, and now Amazon is a world leader in e-books," said Aaron Levie, co-founder and CEO of Box, a popular online content sharing platform. "The analogy holds true for newspapers. Bezos knows that transformation incredibly well and he can help them navigate that transition."<br><br>

The first casualty of this shift will likely be newspapers themselves. Bezos remarked to a German paper last year that printed news would largely disappear in 20 years.
<br><br>
Bezos could emulate Netflix Inc CEO Reed Hastings, said Levie, transforming a physical distribution network into a streaming service that adapts to customers' choices. That means more real-time news delivered via PCs, tablets and phones.<br><br>

Readers can already get the Post on Amazon's Kindle - as well as on Apple Inc's iPad and other devices powered by Google Inc - but a closer tie-up seems likely.<br><br>

One idea would be for the Post to offer news via a branded tablet, perhaps given away with a one-year subscription, much as phone companies subsidize handsets, said Thomas Russo, a partner of the Gardner Russo & Gardner investment firm, one of the biggest Washington Post Co shareholders. Amazon for a long time sold its Kindle e-readers at cost, effectively giving away a device through which buyers then access its online trove.<br><br>

"With technology being what it is, that would not be financially crippling," said Russo, adding that by moving readers off expensive printed papers, "You would have re-oriented your cost structure."<br><br>

AMAZON FOCUS<br><br>

Perhaps Amazon's greatest strength is its knowledge of customers built up through their buying history, which makes the company a very efficient marketer. That technology applied to the Post could make its advertising business much more valuable.<br><br>

"Nobody knows more about Internet media distribution than Jeff Bezos," said Richard Brandt, author of 'One Click: Jeff Bezos and the Rise of Amazon.com.' "If anyone can figure out how to do this profitably, it is he. That will benefit the Post and, possibly, all media organizations."<br><br>

Bezos wrote in a letter to Post employees that he did not intend to get involved in day-to-day management of the paper, and would leave news production to the existing leadership team. But he did hint at a shift to a more local, personalized idea of news, which echoes Amazon's approach to customers.<br><br>

"Our touchstone will be readers, understanding what they care about - government, local leaders, restaurant openings, scout troops, businesses, charities, governors, sports - and working backwards from there," wrote Bezos.<br><br>

His purchase of the Post could be viewed as an extension of Amazon's move towards content creation, most recently creating its own movies and TV series, which gives the company a new way of engaging with customers.<br><br>

"'News' is the digital equivalent of a high-traffic intersection: as people pass through to figure out what's happening they might also stop to do some shopping," wrote Henry Blodget, founder and CEO of news site Business Insider, which Bezos has also invested in. "Content and commerce companies have long dabbled with combining the two experiences, but no one has really nailed it."<br><br>

Bezos has time to work out a formula. He has shown at Amazon that he is willing to work on ideas for years before they become profitable. And by making the purchase personal, he has removed demanding shareholders from the equation.<br><br>

The Post is already one of the more prominent print publications on the web. The Washington Post Co's online publishing activities, primarily washingtonpost.com and Slate, took in $29.8 million in revenue for the second quarter of 2013, up 15 percent from a year ago. Slate is not included in the sale to Bezos.<br><br>

That is just over 20 percent of The Washington Post Co's overall newspaper publishing revenue, but is in line with other large papers. The company earned much greater revenue from its education and cable TV operations.<br><br>

"The Washington Post has already been one of the most forward-thinking newsrooms," said Box's Levie, citing its WaPo Labs project, a team that experiments with new ways of providing news from a 'Social Reader' Facebook app to the Trove personalized news gatherer, which pulls from 10,000 sources. WaPo Labs is also not included in the sale.<br><br>

"They have already been fairly tech-savvy," said Levie. "It's a business that has to transform itself from print to digital and they've done a pretty good job doing so. The benefit of having an owner like Jeff Bezos is you'll be able to continue to fund those experiments."<br><br>

	<b><a name="T8">The Washington Post: Why Jeff Bezos and Not Warren Buffett?</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
August 7, 2013<br><br>


Posted by John Cassidy<br><br>


Among the many questions about the sale of the Washington Post to Jeff Bezos, here are a couple I haven’t seen discussed much, except in a post at Fortune on Tuesday: Why didn’t Warren Buffett buy the paper? And what does it mean that he passed it over?<br><br>

Once the Graham family decided to sell, it’s unthinkable that the legendary investor didn’t get a chance to put in a bid. After all, he served on the board of the Washington Post Company for more than two decades, and the huge conglomerate he runs, Berkshire Hathaway, has been the largest outside shareholder in the Post Company since the nineteen-seventies. (The value of Berkshire’s stake in the company rose to about a billion dollars after the news of the sale, from which Berkshire reportedly stands to make about fifty million dollars.) And in recent years, Berkshire has bought a bunch of newspapers, including Buffett’s local one, the Omaha World-Herald. In his annual letter to Berkshire’s shareholders this year, Buffett wrote, “I love newspapers and, if their economics make sense, will buy them even when they fall far short of the size threshold we would require for the purchase of, say, a widget company.”<br><br>


In some ways, Buffett would have been an ideal purchaser. He’s a long-term investor, he doesn’t have any big political agenda―the causes he does support, such as higher taxes on the wealthy, aren’t self-serving―and he thinks serious newspapers, especially ones with a strong grip on their local market such as the Post, still have a future. Here’s a passage from Berkshire’s 2013 annual report: <br><br>


[We] believe that papers delivering comprehensive and reliable information to tightly-bound communities and having a sensible Internet strategy will remain viable for a long time. We do not believe that success will come from cutting either the news content or frequency of publication. Indeed, skimpy news coverage will almost certainly lead to skimpy readership. And the less-than-daily publication that is now being tried in some large towns or cities―while it may improve profits in the short term―seems certain to diminish the papers’ relevance over time. Our goal is to keep our papers loaded with content of interest to our readers and to be paid appropriately by those who find us useful, whether the product they view is in their hands or on the Internet.<br><br>


So why didn’t Buffett buy the Post? One issue may have been the price. In informing Berkshire’s stockholders that he intended to keep buying papers, he stipulated “at appropriate prices―and that means at very low multiples of earnings.” The price Bezos paid―two hundred and fifty million dollars in cash, minus a fifty-million-dollar contribution from the Post toward the future pension costs of its employees―didn’t meet Buffett’s standard, and that’s putting it mildly. In the past twelve months, the Post Company’s newspaper division, which includes some local titles, has posted an operating loss of close to seventy million dollars. Now, most of these losses came in the form of non-cash adjustments, which were related to early-retirement and pension charges. But even if you exclude that stuff, the newspaper division lost about a million dollars over the past year, which means its earnings multiple was negative―hardly a buy signal for a value investor like Buffett.<br><br>

On the other hand, a million bucks a year isn’t a gaping loss. And under the terms of the sale, the buyer has been largely protected from future retiree costs, which is a crushing issue for almost all newspapers. If Buffett really believed the Post could turn itself around and make some decent profits going forward, he might well have been willing to bear the short-term costs. Evidently, he didn’t believe this―and for good reasons that Bezos will quickly have to address.<br><br>

The problem with the Post is that it’s neither fish nor fowl―or, rather, it’s both. First and foremost, it’s a metropolitan newspaper with a near monopoly on the market in D.C. and its environs. I don’t know what the figure is these days, but years ago it used to have a market share of more than ninety per cent, which translated into a very lucrative business of selling advertising space for things like real estate, job openings, and retail. But the Post was (and is) also a paper with ambitions of challenging the Times and the Wall Street Journal on the national stage, which means it has to spend a lot of money on national and international reporting.<br><br>

As long as its local advertising franchise held up, its two roles were complementary. The ads paid for the news budget and allowed the paper to keep its cover price low. (For years, it was twenty-five cents on weekdays.) But as the ads moved online and the paper shrank, those two missions started to come into conflict with each other. With ad revenues shrinking, the paper was forced to cut back on staffing and raise its price. That hit circulation, which reduced the prices the paper could charge for the remaining ads. The Grahams were in a bind. They didn’t want to give up on the Post’s larger ambitions by taking an axe to the editorial budget, but they were unwilling to see the paper drag down its parent company’s earnings and stock price. Failing to see a way out of the downward spiral, they eventually decided to sell.<br><br>

Assuming he means to run the Post as a business rather than a philanthropic or vanity project, Bezos will have to make a choice. One option will be to double-down on the fast-growing economy of D.C. and its environs, and make the Post a comprehensive multimedia portal for the region, with localized print editions and Web pages, detailed local listings, and extensive coverage of things like crime, restaurants, and sports. Buffett is right: there’s still a market for this sort of product, especially when it’s delivered across various media platforms at an affordable price. But it’s a relatively modest market that is unlikely to sustain overseas news coverage, lengthy investigative projects, and other costly journalistic pursuits.<br><br>

The other option is riskier but more ambitious: rekindling the spirit of Ben Bradlee and challenging the Times as the affluent, thinking person’s newspaper. Such a strategy would involve beefing up―and livening up―the paper’s coverage of politics, which once set the standard but in recent years has been challenged by the Times and by other news organizations, like Politico and Roll Call. It would mean expanding the paper’s lifestyle and cultural coverage, which is relatively weak, and using the Web in innovative ways to attract readers outside the D.C. area, especially younger ones. If Bezos is intent on making the paper pay for itself, it would also involve charging the readers of the Post more, both online and offline. (Even today, after a series of price rises, the weekday print edition of the Post costs just $1.25―half the price of the Times.) Most of all, such a strategy would involve rebranding the Post as a cool multimedia product rather than a gray pile of dead wood. <br><br>

Even if Bezos did all these things, and added a few tricks of his own, there would be no guarantee of success. (The Times has already tried most of these tactics, and it’s still struggling financially.) But it would be interesting to watch.<br><br>

<a href= "link05.html">中国领导人需克制野心</a><br><br>
贝佐斯不是在救新闻业？-BUFFETT买社区小报<br><br>

编译自《华尔街》，作者：理查德圣维勒斯 <br><br>

贝佐斯。<br><br>

“有一点我很肯定：印刷报纸将在 20 年内消失。就算存在的话，它们也将被看作某些酒店作为一种高端服务向顾客提供的奢侈品。”这是去年 11 月杰夫贝佐斯向德国《柏林时报》说的话。<br><br>

因此， 这位亚马逊公司创始人兼 CEO 8 月 5 日斥资 2.5 亿美元，向华盛顿邮报公司收购亏损的《华盛顿邮报》一事让人大跌眼镜。新闻稿称收购者并非 Amazon.com，而是贝佐斯个人。<br><br>

他为什么会拿这样一笔钱―虽然只占其财富的一小部分―去冒风险？外界众说纷纭，最流行的观点是：贝佐斯是个好人，想要拯救新闻业。<br><br>

但新闻不光报纸有。要拯救它的话，贝佐斯完全可以花少得多的钱，去创办一所新闻学院，或者索性向某个新闻学院捐一大笔钱。<br><br>

我认为收购《华邮》是贝佐斯的一大精明妙着，目标是权势和影响力――精明的贝佐斯意识到亚马逊受的政治压力。<br><br>

他目睹了沃尔玛等对手是如何遭媒体绞杀的――从员工低薪、挤垮“爸妈小店”到把生产外包给中国，负面话题的不断纠缠，让这家做过不少好事的零售巨擘几乎无暇喘息。亚马逊尽管采取了相似的营销策略，却始终被媒体放了一马。<br><br>

你以为贝佐斯对挤垮家庭式小书店会内疚吗？对以前的对手如博德斯、达尔顿等被亚马逊网店或电子书逼得关门，连百思买也只剩奄奄一息，又有谁在乎呢？亚马逊身后留下的满地残骸血迹说明，亚马逊算不上一个心地善良的企业公民。<br><br>

必须声明一点：本人经常在亚马逊购物，体验也很愉快。不过我很清楚，亚马逊的优势之一是它只需缴纳很少的物业税，销售税则与它无关。假如没有这些，我不相信它可以为顾客省那么多钱。它的超低价和包邮优惠让我们很开心，但各个州却少了亟需的税入。亚马逊还因为操纵电子书价格，伤害了巴诺书店等同行而受抨击。<br><br>

我根本不相信贝佐斯收购《华邮》是出于“人道理由”的说法，此举只有一个目的：保住亚马逊的零售和媒介帝国。<br><br>


贝索斯的轮回<br><br>

《经济学人》 8月6日 <br><br>


美国《华盛顿邮报》公司8月5日宣布，亚马逊(Amazon)创办人杰夫贝索斯个人以 2.5 亿美元买下公司旗舰报《华盛顿邮报》及旗下数家地方报纸。邮报主席兼首席执行长唐纳德格拉汉姆称贝索斯是一位“独一无二的、合适的新东家”。<br><br>

也许杰夫贝索斯相信因果轮回。爱书者和作者们通常怪罪他，认为是其一手创办的电商亚马逊毁了图书业。但 8 月 5 日，贝索斯却化身成为老牌纸媒的拯救者。华盛顿邮报公司宣布将旗下最重头的报纸《华盛顿邮报》以及部分附属报纸，以 2.5 亿美元的价格卖给贝索斯个人。<br><br>

交易过程如此秘而不宣，甚至连业界顶尖的《华盛顿邮报》记者对此都不知情。这场收购结束了格雷厄姆家族 80 年来对于该报的掌管。1933 年银行家尤金迈耶就以 82.5 万美元买下濒临破产的报纸。<br><br>

未来贝索斯会接管大部分的报业出版业务，而旗下教育公司 Kaplan 以及杂志《外交政策》等，则仍将由华盛顿邮报公司保留。<br><br>

《华盛顿邮报》现任老板、迈耶的外孙唐纳德格雷厄姆和报纸出版人、迈耶的曾孙女凯瑟琳韦姆斯，也曾力图扭转局势、但他们却眼睁睁看着发行量和利润双双下滑。去年公司报纸发行收入为 5.28 亿美元，与 2007 年相比下降了35%。而这期间公司的姿态发生了彻底的转变。2007 年度报告称其是“大型报纸之中前景最佳的”。但其后经济衰退扼杀了广告收入，发行量则逐年下降。2012 年度报告中，他们预示般地宣称，“面对着分类广告的损失，本地零售商的国有化，以及持续减少的读者数，我们并无能长久盈利的方案。”<br><br>

去年《华盛顿邮报》损失了 5400 万美元。尽管坚持多年没有使用付费墙，《华盛顿邮报》还是自今年 6 月开始对网络内容收费。但是，无人看好这会对报纸长期的经济收入维持有何帮助。格雷厄姆在声明中说道。“新闻报业持续出问题，而我们却无法解答。凯瑟琳和我开始扪心自问，自己这家小上市公司是否仍然是报纸的最佳归宿。”<br><br>

贝索斯高度赞扬格雷厄姆家庭的“勇气”，称其勇敢体现在其报纸的新闻方面，也体现在他们愿意将报纸出售。行业分析师肯道科特认为，如今报纸的价值可能只是十年前的十分之一。然而，这对以廉价销售商品坐拥上百亿公司的贝索斯来说，近几年来报业的衰退和对其未来负面展望，反倒帮助他能以低廉价格买下这份报纸。<br><br>


如何成为数字时代的“广告狂人”？ <br><br>

译者/何黎<br><br>
2013年08月12日 <br><br>
 
Della Femina/Jeary & Partners董事长 杰瑞德拉菲米纳 为英国《金融时报》撰稿 <br><br>

 


阳狮集团(Publicis)和宏盟集团（Omnicom，又称奥姆尼康）宣布合并<br><br>
“谷歌和Facebook正在向我们发起攻击，”麦迪逊大道(Madison Avenue，美国广告业的代名词――译者注)发出了惊呼。“进入防御模式，”这是法国做出的回答。于是，全球两大广告公司阳狮集团(Publicis)和宏盟集团（Omnicom，又称奥姆尼康）宣布合并。鉴于现在的广告相对于《广告狂人》(Mad Men)描述的时代更加依赖于算法，这起合并案被解读为广告行业黄金时代的结束。《广告狂人》是反映二十世纪六十年代美国广告业风貌的系列电视剧。新闻媒体认为，这一举措表明两家广告公司正在扩充资源，以对抗硅谷巨头。<br><br>

但这种观点的问题在于，它是建立在两个站不住脚的假设之上的。它一方面假设，未来将不可避免地出现一种数字驱动、可预知型的数字广告模式。当你搜索“轮胎”时，会看到一条广告，告诉你在距你当前位置一英里处有商家在特价销售米其林(Michelin)轮胎。而另一方面，这种观点将《广告狂人》式的创意技巧过分浪漫化了――在该剧集中，三个精明练达的男人一边坐着品尝鸡尾酒，一边随意聊着如何推销从植发疗程到汽车保险等各种商品的构想。<br><br>
以上两种夸张的假设都有一定的道理。但如果广告业要在如今的互联网时代蓬勃发展，则必须将数字化定位媒体投放的高效率与《广告狂人》的非凡创意结合起来。能够做到这一点的机构，无论是大型企业集团还是小公司，都将引领广告业第二个黄金时代的潮流。事实上，或许用不了多久我们就能看到一部热播电视剧（或者网络连续剧），用夸张的手法描绘当效率成为时髦的时刻。<br><br>
Publicis Omnicom Group<br><br>
新成立的阳狮宏盟集团(Publicis Omnicom Group)的命运有待书写。即将出任联合首席执行官的莫里斯雷维(Maurice Levy)和庄任(John Wren)或许撑不过他们协议共事的30个月。但如果这笔跨越大西洋的合并交易促使业界更深刻地理解到，优秀的广告公司应当管理好创意与效率之间的协同效应，那么该交易对于整个广告行业来说将是一个变革性的时刻。我们应关注如下三个问题。<br><br>



第一，定向投放的数字化广告是否也能充满创意？如今在适当的时间和地点将广告定向展示给适当的人已经成为可能。但这还远远不够。声称客户细分已经寿终正寝，并根据输入数据自动生成一大串广告，也不足以让人满意。如果这些广告缺乏感染力，那么就和噪音没有区别。我们追求推特转发、点赞以及引领潮流的过程中，已经忘记了品牌是可以通过广告来打造的。广告可以创造出技术手段无法超越的宏大构想。这正是广告的魔力所在，也正是如今的很多广告所欠缺的。<br><br>

第二，即便是创意广告也必须以高效地制作出来并投放出去，以实现通过提升品牌形象带动产品销售的基本目标。很多情况下，客户方面的决策者缺乏经验，无法区分一条华而不实的广告与一条能提高销量的广告。资金被浪费在了消费者无法理解的广告上。这些广告或许能够在戛纳(Cannes)广告节上获奖，但对提高销量没有帮助。<br><br>

解决途径在于思考如何改进流程：即关键决策是如何做出的？直到不久以前，知识经济企业很少按照这种思路考虑问题。如今，我们看到制造业、专业服务等多个行业已经致力于提高效率。是时候把这种思维模式引入广告业了。<br><br>
谷歌的定向广告模式之所以颇具吸引力，是因为它宣称能够减少无用功。我们必须思考如何提高创意的效率。如果做法得当，或许甚至能够催生出更精彩的创意。雷维和庄任、以及管理着全球最优秀品牌的首席营销官们，应当学习制造以及供应管理领域的一些企业所树立起来的榜样。<br><br>

第三，必须有效管理创意团队以及创意资产。团队之间必须实时协同合作，以释放出更多的资源，推动公司的创新和成长。这一点在国际商业机器公司(IBM)和埃森哲(Accenture)身上得到了体现。这两家公司都拥有高度复杂的人员和资源配置机制，并都运用了追踪系统以监控效率并确保高效。这种基于数据的监控系统已被证明既不会威胁，也不会阻碍创造力的发挥。事实上，数据使得一系列新工具的运用成为可能，管理人可以借助这些工具培养各个团队的创造能力。<br><br>

这起跨大西洋合并案激发了我们的想象力，因为它是全球商业领域发生的一件彰显个性与魅力的重大事件。从现在开始，苹果(Apple)、宝洁(Procter & Gamble)和可口可乐(Coca-Cola)等公司将成为同一家大型广告公司的客户。但该合并案的价值将体现为新巨头能否催生广告行业第二个黄金时代。而新巨头若想实现这一目标，唯有把数据、二十一世纪新出现的分析方法与广告业第一个黄金时代的构想以及天才创意融合到一起，使工作效率和创意能力同时得到提升。<br><br>

投资者对阳狮集团(Publicis)和宏盟集团（Omnicom，又称奥姆尼康）价值350亿美元的并购反应冷淡。并购将缔造的新的法美企业作为全球广告和营销行业领军企业，正面临客户、监管机构、竞争对手和分析师的密切关注。<br><br>

以营收计分别为业内第二大和第三大的两家企业意外合并，有望带来每年5亿美元的协同效益，但两家企业的股东都没有获得溢价。阳狮集团股票在巴黎股市收于每股59.50欧元，仅上涨0.25%，宏盟集团股价在纽约午盘为每股65.27美元，涨幅跟前者不相上下。
两家公司的竞争对手们乘机表示，这种反应证明，投资者对这桩可能改变业内竞争格局的交易感到担忧。从谷歌(Google)到埃森哲(Accenture)等新入者纷纷进入广告业，已经令该行业面临压力。以营收计全球最大的广告企业WPP的首席执行官苏铭天爵士(Sir Martin Sorrell)表示：“市场反应表达的是，他们不认可这种策略。”<br><br>

苏铭天爵士表示，他认为WPP不需要进行类似收购作为回应，比如收购另一家大型广告代理公司，比如埃培智市场咨询(Interpublic)或哈瓦斯(Havas)，尽管前者股价纽约午盘上涨4%，后者收涨近5%。巴克莱(Barclays)分析师表示，阳狮集团与宏盟集团在媒体购买市场所占份额之和很大，可能有必要处置一些资产，但补充道，他们看不出重大的监管风险。阳狮首席执行官莫里斯莱维(Maurice Lévy)和宏盟首席执行官庄任(John Wren)重申，他们预计该交易最快将于今年底获得批准。<br><br>

　　肯尼亚野生动物旅游资源非常丰富，马赛马拉国家森林公园是世界上最好的野生动物观赏地之一。导游彼得带领来自英国的情侣切尔西和布莱德，深入马赛马拉国家森林公园腹地观赏野生动物。他们开车穿行于开阔的原野、广袤的灌木林带，在连绵起伏的热带稀树大草原里，寻找成群的狮子、大象、犀牛、野水牛、猎豹等动物。片中，通过展示马赛马拉国家公园巡警肯尼迪的工作，和野生动物保护者辛迪的“狮子庄园”，介绍肯尼亚政府及民间对于野生动物保护的决心和力度。<br><br>

　　在肯尼亚西南部和坦桑尼亚北部广袤的草原地带，自古生活着非洲最富传奇色彩的原始部族――马赛族。马赛族先民来自苏丹，他们是尼罗河游牧部落文化的传承者，在东部非洲辽阔的大地上逐水草而居。马赛人的“成人仪式”和“传统婚礼”独具特色，体现着部族的传统文化。<br><br>

　　马赛商人雷欧纳德将祖祖辈辈流传下来的传统服饰开发成马赛特色旅游商品，同时也悄悄地使族人融入现代的市场经济社会。随着交通的逐渐便利，现代文明也来到了原始的部落。如今，莱昂纳多的所有兄弟姐妹都被他带到城里工作、生活，来自马赛族的政治活动家、公职人员、海外留学生也与日俱增，传统的马赛族生活方式正在发生着巨大变化。<br><br>


纪录片《发现肯尼亚》：来自东非海岸的传奇 <br><br>



2013-08-13 光明网　 <br><br>
 

　　肯尼亚，一个遥远而神秘的国度。在它的东海岸、印度洋西北部边缘，不仅有着丰富的古代中国历史文化遗存，还流传着当地居民源自中国人后裔的说法。沉睡海底的大型船只是否来自中国？郑和的船队是否来过此地？明代景德镇官窑瓷器碎片惊现，又说明了什么？以当前正在进行的中肯联合考古为契机，中央电视台纪录频道派出一流创作团队，拍摄了三集高清纪录片《发现肯尼亚》，让您知晓中国和肯尼亚之间的历史交流，了解中国海上丝绸之路的发展，关注肯尼亚自身文明的变迁。8月12日至14日，该片登陆央视综合频道（CCTV-1）每晚十点半档的《魅力纪录》栏目，与观众们见面。<br><br>



　　揭开重重谜团，还原历史真相<br><br>

　　2010年，中国与肯尼亚两国正式启动一项联合考古项目，中国国家博物馆和北京大学考古文博学院联合肯尼亚国家博物馆共同完成对肯尼亚的陆地和水下考古工作，合作项目的经费由中国商务部无偿援助，计划三年完成。据导演李侠介绍，两国专家在肯尼亚对岛内建筑和各类文化遗址进行考古发现，并针对肯尼亚境内，海上丝路沿线诸多最有可能的历史沉船位置进行潜水作业，定点勘察，以确定沉船的准确位置、船体大小等。<br><br>

　　“东非海岸一直以来是海上重要的贸易地，中国的古代商船在几百年前就曾远渡重洋、将东方的文化带到这里，并留下珍贵的历史遗存，此次中肯联合考古，正是期待挖掘这些大量的实物证据，丰富人们对于航海史、贸易史以及中非交流史的认识。”他表示。<br><br>

　　导演陶涛说，此次考古行动是中国水下、陆地考古队伍首次在境外展开工作，这不仅向全世界展示了中国考古队伍的专业水准与成就，同时也讲述了辉煌灿烂的古代中国海洋文化。他说：“纪录片《发现肯尼亚》将全面记录这次划时代的考古行动，以一种现在进行时态，伴随中肯双方考古队探索历史未知，考古勘察并发掘水下文化遗存和陆上遗址、遗物，解读中非古代文化交流、经贸往来的一些神秘谜团。”<br><br>

　　例如，片中以大量的寻访和考证，试图解答历史之谜：中国郑和船队到底有没有到过肯尼亚，是否真有船员留下与当地人结婚生子？拉穆岛上的很多居民相信自己是中国人的后代，他们拥有的祖传瓷碗是否来自于古代中国？拥有类似中医治疗技法的当地医师，医术传承自于祖先，是否意味着中国医生几百年前曾驻足于此？这些问题直接指向肯尼亚的文化历史，这些谜团也是全球历史学界研究的热点。跟随《发现肯尼亚》的镜头，你会发现，摄制组通过实地考古发掘和探索，深入纪录了肯尼亚人的现实文化生活，依托大量第一手的独家影像资料，拨开谜团的重雾，还原历史真相。<br><br>


顶尖水下摄影，呈现视觉奇观<br><br>

　　在肯尼亚拍摄的四个多月时间里，剧组与中肯两国考古专家紧密合作，深入最偏僻的村落，捕捉到了难得一见的镜头。例如，极具异域风情的班图人婚礼，新娘身上震慑人心的纹身图案，肯尼亚最古老的家谱……摄制组全程采用纪实拍摄手法，深入肯尼亚人的文化生活，努力表现肯尼亚最真实的部落生态、最虔诚的宗教信仰与最标致性的文化样貌，通过镜头深入探寻，发现肯尼亚除国家旅游形象之外，那些不为人知的现实生活与历史秘密。<br><br>

　　在片中，您还能看到奇幻的水下影像。这些特殊画面的获得，是由国际专职水下摄影团队完成的。该团队曾多次参与创作国际纪录片大片，像《地球脉动》、《人类星球》等。在拍摄《发现肯尼亚》的过程中，他们深潜几十米海底，全程记录了中国考古队发现海底沉船的全部细节与过程。那些考古队员在水下手持卷尺，丈量沉船铁锚的珍贵画面；那些不借助任何潜水装置，徒手射鱼的肯尼亚海底猎人，都会令您眼界大开。<br><br>

　　配音大师的绝唱<br><br>

　　纪录片《发现肯尼亚》，是由配音大师李易解说的，但谁也没有想到，这部作品竟成为李易留给世界的绝唱。<br><br>

　　作为享誉配音界的大家，李易曾为很多影视作品配音，而纪录片是他特别钟爱的一片领域。从早年的《再说长江》、《圆明园》，到近年来的《人类星球》、《南海Ⅰ号》、《春晚》，李易以他浑厚深沉、真诚自然的声音，赢得了纪录片观众的赞誉。央视纪录频道开播两年多来，李易的声音出现在频道热播的众多节目中，他和他的团队，塑造了纪录频道高雅端庄的声音形象。<br><br>

　　今年6月中旬，李易被确诊为急性白血病。临去住院之前，他还连续工作了5天，把手边的工作做完，其中，就包括为《发现肯尼亚》的预告片配音。7月23日凌晨，李易作别人世。《发现肯尼亚》终成他最后的解说作品。<br><br>

　　让我们在《发现肯尼亚》中，再次聆听李易那饱含深情的声音吧。（记者牛梦笛）<br><br>


央视新大楼：大国雄心之建筑版<br><br>

2009年02月10日  青年参考<br><br>

5年前，当荷兰人库哈斯公布他们的中央电视台新总部大楼的设计方案时，人们简直不敢相信建筑还可以这么做。<br><br>

　　从技术上讲，这座建筑存在很大难度。建筑外形就像是一只被扭曲的正方形油炸圈；两座竖立的塔楼向内倾斜，倾角很大；塔楼之间被横向的结构连接起来，总体形成一个闭合的环。<br><br>

　　这样一种回旋式结构在建筑界还没有现成的施工规范可循。库哈斯和舍人认为，这种结构是对建筑界传统观念的一次挑战。人们通常认为摩天大楼就应该高耸入云直指天空。<br><br>

　　现在，整座建筑的施工很快就要进入关键环节：几周后，工人们就要开始对横结构施工。这部分的技术要求听起来很有点科幻小说的味道：在半空中连接两座塔楼的部分，必须在太阳出来前施工，因为阳光会让塔楼不同部位的钢结构膨胀，从而不利于控制施工质量。<br><br>

　　在北京正在建设的大约10000座新建筑中，CCTV大楼可能是最能显示勃勃雄心的一座，人们在谈到建筑界把北京称为外国建筑师的“东方淘金地”、“试验田”时，每每都会以它作为典型代表。舍人说，这种结构在世界其他地方获准建造的可能性很小，因为其他地方的建筑规范不会允许建造这样的东西。而中国现在很愿意尝试，这为建筑设计创造了一种非常特别的氛围。<br><br>

　　为成功举办奥运会，中国政府希望能让北京这座古老城市，变成一座现代化大都会。在所有新建筑中，设计造价8亿美元的CCTV新大楼，带给公众的视觉冲击最强烈。建成后，它将成为中央电视台这个中国惟一全国性电视台的象征，同时，它也是规模仅次于美国五角大楼的世界第二大办公楼。<br><br>

　　CCTV大楼主体连接工程将从这个月底开始动工，其中悬空的横结构最终将在明年2月前完工。当年曾担任CCTV 大楼设计竞赛评委的香港建筑师严迅奇说，起初他对这个“极其疯狂的设计方案”持相当保留的态度，但到后来，他感觉这个设计能代表“某种精神，这种精神也正是中国在新时期展现出来的东西：不惧权威，敢于尝试，无所畏惧，高度自信”。<br><br>

　　塔楼连接部分的结构借鉴了桥梁建筑技术，不同的是，如果把那部分看作“桥”，它将是一座大得出奇、非常笨重的桥。这个桥的某些部分有整整11层楼高，桥上还包括一段伸出75米的悬臂，前端没有任何支撑。<br><br>

　　按照惯例，设计阶段结束后，施工监督通常由当地建筑师承担。但为确保设计方案得到更好落实，今年36岁的舍人 2004年做出了一个不同寻常的决定：搬到北京亲自监督施工。<br><br>

　　北京建筑行业对建造这个设计方案并无现成的规范可用，于是，北京市政府组织13位结构专家成立了一个特别小组。在设计竞赛两年后，CCTV新总部大楼获准开工建设。接下来，专家组做了一个3层楼高的复制品用来研究。它被放在一个能模拟地震的液压平台上，上面安装了数百个传感器，用来监控“塔楼”上1万多条钢梁的位移，并测量在不同情况下哪个部位承受的压力最大。<br><br>

　　CCTV大楼外面由大面积玻璃窗与菱形钢网格结合而成，作为大楼主体架构，这些钢网格暴露在建筑最外面，而不是像大多数建筑那样深藏其中。舍人说，这样压力基本都能沿着系统传递下去，并找到导入地面的最佳路径。从外观上看，大楼有一部分钢网结构(包括拐角等压力较大部位)比较密集，它们也是整体设计思想的一部分。<br><br>

　　此外，大楼外面将采用特种玻璃，其表面被烧制成灰色瓷釉，能更有效遮蔽日晒。舍人说，这也更适应北京的空气质量。实际上，在空气污染很严重的日子里，这种玻璃就像融化在空气中似的，人们只能看到大楼的网状结构，彷佛闪电被凝固在空中。<br><br>

　　去年，建筑评论家英格？萨弗容曾撰文指出，库哈斯和舍人或许会“将作为让CCTV大楼成为建筑界‘重磅炸弹’ 的人”而被载入史册。萨弗容说，“设计传达的信息非常具有震慑力，想想看，大楼顶部的横结构悬在离地面那么高的架子上。”再加上整个建筑庞大的占地面积，CCTV大楼时刻在提醒你是多么渺小，而它背后代表的这个国家是多么强大。<br><br>

　　舍人说，他自己在这个设计项目中投入了很多。大多数外国建筑师到这个阶段都会完全脱身，把设计交给当地工程师和建筑师去落实，但他说，这么做通常会带来“灾难性的”后果，对他来说，他不想这样。 （作者MeiFong 编译华宝）(美国《华尔街日报》)<br><br>

　　日本民主党政权在2011年完成的“以获取政治安全利益、分享经济红利为主题，实施多元化布局并以中美日三边对话为核心机制”的外交安全战略方向，主要受传统安全上大国关系特别是美国亚太战略的影响。这一方向的确立，标志着日本政界主流及民主党内部多数派在外交安全战略上达成为了共识，其纵深处是对日本国家发展的愿景。受制于其在对世界形势特别是对中国的认知上“近视”的精细和“远视”的误判，这一战略并不能使日本实现“正常国家”的定位。日本民族自身的精神哲学、战后美国的东亚政策是阻碍日本进行历史反思的内外部因素，未尽的历史反思给东亚和平留下了不确定因素，日本的“正常国家”定位也因此难以为东亚国家所接受。<br><br>

　　关键词：日本 历史反思 国家定位 外交战略 安全战略<br><br>

　　在世界大变局的背景下，日本的国家发展处在重大转折时期，今后的国家发展定位是日本所面临的重大问题。日本的国家定位基于对其自身所处国际环境和自身能力的认知。国家定位的实现，取决于为实现国家定位所确定的外交安全战略与其自身所处的客观条件是否一致。日本想要实现“正常国家”[1]的定位目标，得到其周边国家的承认是重要条件之一。由于内外因素影响，战后日本未能实现彻底的历史反思，这不仅客观上限制了日本自身认知能力的提升，也影响了日本与东亚国家特别是中国和韩国实现历史和解。因此，日本的历史反思问题必将成为其实现“正常国家”定位的障碍。本文拟从对2011年日本外交安全战略的分析入手，揭示其战略背后的国家定位目标；分析影响日本实现该定位目标的历史反思不足之障碍，从中透视日本问题的复杂性。<br><br>

　　外交安全战略的纵深：“正常国家”定位<br><br>

　　日本民主党政权在2011年完成了外交安全战略方向的确立。日本外相玄叶光一郎2011年12月14日在日本记者俱乐部的讲话中指出，日本外交的责任是谋求日本国家利益的最大化。玄叶认为，为了规避风险并抓住机遇，日本要继续把日美同盟作为外交安全的基轴，在亚太地区构建多层次的双边、三边、多边的地区对话框架，开展多种多样的协调，支持依照国际法建立国际新秩序。玄叶还特别强调了“中国的发展是机遇”，“为了构筑开放的多层次的合作关系”，“中国的参与是不可或缺的”，而“日美中三国战略对话与协调具有前所未有重要性的时代即将到来”。日本外相近期代表官方所做的一席发言阐明了民主党政权的外交安全战略方向。如果作一个概括，那就是“该战略以获取政治安全利益、分享经济红利为主题，实施多元化布局并以中美日三边对话为核心机制”[2]。日本外交安全战略方向的确立是基于对世界和本地区形势发展的认知，主要受传统安全上大国关系的影响，特别是美国亚太战略的影响。[3]东京财团首席研究员渡边恒雄指出，对于日本来说“2011年是非常重要的一年”，“美国回归亚洲给日本的对华政策带来良机”。[4]美国的战略重心东移提升了日本在美国战略中的存在感。玄叶光一郎在讲话中说：“奥巴马总统表明了这样一种方针，即重新调整美国的外交安全的优先顺序，将亚太地区放在最优先地位。我认为，美国的这一新立场，对于不论以往还是今后都一贯把在亚太地区的日美合作定位为外交支柱之一的日本而言，提供了极其令人深受鼓舞的方向性。”[5]在2011年，美国已经通过高调宣示战略重心东移和遏制中国“扩张”，套紧了日本这个首要同盟；通过“3・11”后的“朋友作战”加深了日本对美国的政治认同；通过日美“2+2”会谈进一步强化了日美同盟的战略地位和区域安全作用。[6]日本则利用美国战略重心东移的机遇，以头号盟国的特殊身份，在亚太地区展开战略行动。<br><br>

　　日本外交安全战略方向的确立标志着日本政界主流以及民主党内部多数派在外交安全战略上达成了共识。这个共识不仅承袭了自民党的政治外交政策观念即以日美同盟为核心，而且相对于自民党时期的“傍美”显示出更大的灵活性。相对于此前的鸠山由纪夫和菅直人，现任首相野田佳彦对日美同盟的必要性、可用性有更明确的认识。野田自称“泥鳅”性格，主张“两足行走”，[7]在强调以日美同盟为基轴构建日本外交安全战略的同时，谋求最大限度地在同盟框架下拓展自主外交，运用军事资源。[8]美国糟糕的财政状况将逐渐给同盟中的日本带来更多的责任和更大的活动空间，同盟作为日本追求国家利益最大化的工具性特点也会更加突出。日本的外交安全战略正在加速从自民党时代传统的“日美同盟下的日本战略”走向“日本战略中的日美同盟”。<br><br>

　　日本民主党的外交安全战略方向的纵深处，是对日本国家发展的愿景。野田佳彦在其“我的政治哲学”中明确指出：“我们要下定决心，自己的国家自己保卫。在这个大前提之下，坚决坚持日美同盟。”这一表述不仅反映了野田等政治家们的政治抱负，也反映出日本并没有因为“失去的二十年”和东日本大地震造成的国难而放弃实现“正常国家”的夙愿。可见，在日本一系列外交安全行动的背后，隐含着扩大战略影响、强化自主防卫力量的战略性目的。目前的外交安全战略是趋近“正常国家”目标的过程和手段。实现“正常国家”目标是战后日本大多数政治家的共同夙愿，只是在不同阶段采取的战略手段不同。吉田茂路线是将防务全部交予美国，日本专治经济发展；当日本经济总量稳居世界第二之后，政治目标便逐渐走上前台，“正常国家”从心底的愿望变为政治口号。在如何实现“正常”的问题上，政治家之间存在分歧，例如鸠山由纪夫主张的路径是重视亚洲和对等的日美关系[9]，野田佳彦所代表的多数派则主张利用日美同盟关系实现军事自立。<br><br>

　　战略选择的局限与身份认知的制约<br><br>

　　日本战略选择的背后，是日本在变化的国际环境中对自己身份的认知，也是日本在变化的世界秩序中对自身角色的选择。2011年日本确立的外交安全战略并不一定能使日本实现“正常国家”的定位。首先，由于日本外交安全战略依旧沿用的是在与最强大国家保持同盟关系中求发展的传统手法，如日本近代以来所经历的那样，这种同盟关系必然随着力量对比的变化而发生变化，具有先天的不稳定性。其次，日本将日美同盟关系凌驾于其他双边关系之上的定位方式，具有不可回避的矛盾性，例如中国与日本的关系不可能是中国与日美同盟的关系，中国与美国的关系也不可能是中国与美日同盟的关系，日本与其他国家的双边关系也并非依照日美同盟关系而运转。再次，虽然以日美同盟为前提的外交安全战略使“安保论争”暂停，但日本突破和平宪法的步伐在速度和力度上都明显加快，现在的“傍美”是在为将来的“脱美”创造条件，美国对此的容忍度以及一旦脱离日美同盟关系的日本能否给亚洲带来安全都将是一个大问号。<br><br>

　　那么，是什么原因导致目前的日本作出上述选择呢？日本的外交安全战略思路表现为对美、对华两条主线，但就当前而言，“中国因素对日本内政外交的影响空前上升，在很大程度上决定着日本对外战略特别是安全战略的走向”。[10]日本在对华关系上，显示出安全上严密防范、经济上深度接触的两面性。[11]从安全方面看，对中国和美国的政治认同差异是影响其战略选择的主要因素，心理认同越差，战略防范越深。中日之间互不信任和防范意识的构成源于复杂的因素，包括历史问题、领土主权争端、中国的快速崛起等。因此，想在短期内扭转这种防范意识并构筑战略互信关系是不可能的。从经济方面看，日本借助中国经济强劲发展之力保持和拉动经济活力的基本框架已成客观定局，并在日本经济界形成共识。因此，我们看到的是，面对“正常国家”目标与自身体量相对缩水的纠结，野田政权在中美两个大国之间寻求自身的利益最大化，一方面借助日美同盟框架最大限度地在外交安全领域伸展自己，另一方面借助中国经济的发展动力带动本国经济增长。<br><br>

　　日本对自身的身份认知更多取决于对中国的认知。对中国认知出错，对自身定位随之出错。从历史上看，面对近代西方国际规则对东亚秩序的冲击，近代日本在认知自己国家身份的过程中，始终把中国作为其自身定位的比照，日本对自身的认识随着对中国的认识的变化逐渐形成。日本一方面把亚洲和中国作为落后的符号，把自身作为文明的符号，以示区别；同时又把自己和中国一起作为“自我”，以亚洲的身份去关注西方的“他者”。[12]面对“西力东渐”，日本的应对是，通过倒幕维新建立了以天皇为首的强大中央统一政权，通过推行“文明开化”、“殖产兴业”和“富国强兵”政策，成功地摆脱了殖民地危机，并成为资本主义国家的一员。日本的“变身”导致了自我认知及对华态度的变化。日本近代思想家福泽谕吉和冈仓天心从不同的方面揭示了日本面对中国时的两种身份，[13]前者是摆脱亚洲的身份，后者是代表亚洲的身份，两者都把文明的符号从欧洲或从中国移动到自己的头上。换言之，无论是把亚洲和中国作为落后的符号与自身相区别，还是把自身作为文明的符号与亚洲或中国相区别，[14]两种身份的定位最终都归结在帝国主义民族国家的性质上。<br><br>

　　值得注意的是，在对世界形势的认知，特别是对中国的认知上，“近视”的精细与“远视”的误判制约着日本的自身定位。为了认知中国，一直以来日本民间和政府的投入是巨大的。除大陆浪人、新闻记者、商界人士外，还有军事情报机构、日清贸易研究所[15]、东亚同文书院[16]、满铁调查部[17]等成建制、有组织地对华调研。对华调研规模之大、持续时间之久以及考察之深入、分析之中的，是日本在对华权益上屡屡得手的重要原因。但是，日本对中国微观“近视”的精细把握并不意味着对中国宏观“远视”把握的准确。日本始终低估了中国的内聚力、抵抗力、潜在力。其对华调研上表现出的精细和对华认知上做出战略误判的特点至今没有改变。<br><br>

　　实现国家定位的自身缺陷：历史反思<br><br>

　　如前所述，日本是经过认识上的思辨后走上战争道路的，这个过程是日本对中国、对东亚乃至对世界的认识过程，也是日本对参与西方资本主义扩张和国际秩序做出权衡和选择的过程。基于上述对亚洲、对中国的认知方式，日本所有的侵略战争最基本的意识形态建构是：在面对欧洲白人殖民的时刻，唯“脱亚入欧”的日本有能力、有责任拯救黄种人。在这套逻辑下，无论是以日英同盟为基础的所谓“协调”路线，还是所谓的“亚洲门罗主义”路线，其区别仅仅在于与欧美国家打交道的方式，而在掠夺亚洲特别是在侵占中国的权益上，近代日本则表现得格外野蛮残暴。日本以“文明”符号赋予自己主宰“东亚新秩序”、构建“大东亚共荣圈”的正当性。这个定位所导致的结果是带给中国等亚洲国家巨大的人身伤害和财产损失。战后的东京审判意味着欧洲和亚洲对日本的拒绝，标志着日本脱了“亚”又没能入得了“欧”。但是，近代日本在“脱亚”与“兴亚”双重变奏下的所作所为，一直没有得到足够的清理。[18]靖国神社问题就是典型的例子。<br><br>

　　自从1984年时任首相中曾根康弘参拜靖国神社并遭到中国政府抗议后，中日之间达成了某种政治默契，即日本政府主要阁僚不再参拜祭祀着甲级战犯的靖国神社。但是，2001－2006年，小泉纯一郎在担任首相的五年半内，却五次参拜靖国神社，使得中日两国关系冷至冰点。靖国神社之所以成为问题，是因为它的祭祀对象和祭祀活动具有肯定侵略战争的政治意义。靖国神社祭祀的“神灵”由将近250万个明治时代以来的战死者名单组成，经国家意志选定。这些名单除14722人之外，绝大多数是在对外战争、特别是在对中国的侵略战争和太平洋战争中的战死者，包括因犯下“破坏和平罪”被东京审判判处死刑的“甲级战犯”[19]。靖国神社具有宗教性表象，其本质是国家的“选灵”和国家的祭祀。战后的日本，在政体与精神上呈现分裂状态，尽管政治体制转变为民主主义，但靖国神社以及遍布全国各地的“忠魂碑”、“彰显碑”、“慰灵碑”却并没有断绝与战前的关系，继续发挥着作为传承“国家主义”载体的作用。[20]靖国神社作为一个祭祀战争死者的场所，起到了昭示价值的符号作用。它不断唤起并创造记忆，体现了一种把侵略战争美化为自卫战争的历史观。虽然近代以来日本国家发动的历次对外侵略战争早已受到国际社会的谴责和国际法庭的审判，但是，靖国神社的合祀逻辑依旧存在，传承的祭祀活动依旧继续。因此，“只要怀有受害记忆的邻国国民的个体的、族群的记忆没有消失，官方参拜行为所引起的对日本国家的愤怒和批判就不会停止”。[21]<br><br>

　　战后的日本宪法第二十条第三款规定，国家及其机关不得支持、不得参与任何宗教行为，即坚持“政教分离”原则。日本国家首相、政府职员等都具有国家机构的公职身份，他们参拜靖国神社的行为本身显然是违反宪法的。在这个问题上，日本国内的认识是分裂的，在一些公职人员和政治家参拜的同时，大部分知识分子反对参拜靖国神社。[22]在1991年，仙台高等法院曾在判决中认定首相身份参拜靖国神社的做法“不妥”；[23]对于小泉首相参拜靖国神社，曾经有六个地方法院受理十起诉讼，其中，福冈地方法院和大阪高等法院曾判定其参拜行为“违宪”；[24]但日本最高法院以各种理由从未受理过此类诉讼，对首相参拜的“违宪”问题采取回避态度。<br><br>

　　战后，仅凭天皇的一份投降诏书无论如何不可能清理日本近百年的思想积淀。也正是因为缺少对自身、对东亚受害国的反思，缺少对日本国家发展道路选择上的反思，才使得日本形式上的道歉是那么单薄与苍白，而历史的包袱却被日本自己装载得越发复杂和沉重。值得注意的是，靖国神社问题并没有在日本国内引起违宪争论，也未引起任何政治信任危机，许多人并未把保留和参拜靖国神社、甚至首相的参拜行为看得那么重。而在日本以外的国家看来，对问题轻视的本身已经不可思议，这样的“正常国家”很难被接受。<br><br>

　　阻碍历史反思的内在因素<br><br>

　　正确面对所犯的错误，对任何一个国家或任何一个民族来说都不是一件容易的事。这不仅需要勇气，更需要内心深处虔诚的忏悔，实现人性良知的升华和道德责任的再现。德国总理勃兰特在波兰犹太人殉难者纪念碑前那深深感动世界的一跪，体现了战后德国深刻的反省和承担责任的诚意和决心，为德意志赢得了全世界特别是欧洲各国的信任和谅解。东亚受害国家的人民经常把欧洲的和解进程作为参照，把“跪下的是勃兰特，站起的是德意志”与免于天皇战争责任的“暧昧的日本”相比，他们难以理解，为什么说声“对不起”对日本是如此之难。或许，我们必须意识到：日本根本就不会做出虔诚的忏悔。<br><br>

　　中国学者一直在寻找日本“不正常”的原因。首先对日本的神国观念、皇国史观、绝对主义天皇制观念以及走向法西斯主义的内在原因作出了分析。有学者指出，日本的神话是以国家神话作为统一自然神话和文化神话的主导理念的。《古事记》和《日本书纪》分别记述神代以及从神代进入历史，从远皇祖[25]、皇祖[26]到现实中的天皇，皇体万世一系；神话中国土的生成、国土的经营、国家的形成均为天神生养，这种神话“在其他民族中是罕见的，它是日本神话所具有的特征”。这种皇国一体的“大和魂”就是日本民族精神的哲学本体。[27]还有学者指出，日本近代的两部法律构成日本主流意识形态：1889年枢密院颁布的《大日本帝国宪法》以“近代国家最高法的形式，把由神话所构筑的民族传说确定为日本国家的正史”，1890年明治天皇颁布的《教育敕语》把对国体的信仰和守护确立为日本国民的最高道德。此外，祭政一致的神祈国家的理念以法律的形式被确定下来，“神道的国家”延伸出“国家的神道”，其最高祭祀者天皇位于神道祭祀体系的顶点。“这种对文明与科学的亵渎，以及在精神形态上对国民的愚弄，在世界近代史上是罕见的”。[28]<br><br>

　　尽管战后天皇走下了神坛，但曾经的“现人神”仍旧不属于“国民”中的一员。由于天皇被免除战争责任，“天皇制”得以保留，皇室的尊严、道德形象依旧不可触动。同时，作为天皇神话表征的伊势神宫依旧庄严而神秘，“日本是神国”的话语仍未被封存。第二次世界大战结束后，民主德国和联邦德国废弃了当年纳粹德国的旗帜和歌曲，而日本的“日之丸”和“君之代”却没有得到处置，日本民族心中象征国家主义的文化符号得以延续。2006年，时任首相安倍晋三推动日本国会修改了《教育基本法》，“日之丸”和“君之代”再一次以国家权力的形式成为教化的先导，传承并深化世代普遍的心灵意识，留下的则是模糊的道德基准和历史记忆。<br><br>

　　由此也许可以理解，为什么当东亚国家谴责参拜靖国神社、要求历史反思时，以“国民感情”、“遗族感情”为理由的日本的政治舆论却可以在光天化日之下大行其道；为什么日本社会已然可以平静地接受抽掉了道德和理性的宗教情感，而不去追究“情感的正当性”。“战争”被说成“事件”，“侵略”被说成“推进”，“无条件投降”和“战败”被说成“战争结束”，甲级战犯被作为“忠魂”和“英灵”供奉在靖国神社……他们以极大的热忱在细节或数字上为加害行为进行辩解，而不惜对受害人造成更大的伤害。在历史反思问题上，道德的力量显得极其弱小。有学者在对日本人的心理进行剖析时指出，“以退为进‘罪己’心理与既往不咎的‘祓禊’心理”是日本人迟迟不愿意坦诚认罪的心理因素。[29]无论怎样，一直到今天，无论怎样追求与世界文明的同步，日本社会对世界的反应仍然是以自身的精神哲学为本源。<br><br>

　　阻碍历史反思的外部因素<br><br>

　　战后美国的东亚政策是阻碍日本进行历史反思的外部因素。众所周知，日本政治体制的解体与重构是在战后的瞬间完成的，是在不得不接受《波茨坦宣言》的情况下才放弃战争与明治宪法的。当刚刚走出战争的大多数日本人还处在战败失落和精神虚脱的状态，日本社会充斥着饥饿、贫困的混乱时，美军快速实施的占领政策满足了日本人对社会稳定过渡的物质和精神需要。但是，全民反思的缺位和天皇制的保留以及旧官僚体制的复活，使日本社会没有得到完成意识形态彻底变革的机会。日本战后初期的一切来自于外部的强力推动，不能不使得日本的“市民革命”带有外观性，缺少内在的反思。本来，一个民族对自身发动的战争的反省，需要经历一个相当长的思想认识过程，只有理性地思辨清楚才能够真正与过去彻底决裂并走向光明的崭新的未来，而美国没有给予日本这个“精神审判”自己的机会和时间。[30]<br><br>

　　美国作为外部因素和冷战的一方代表，在促进欧洲和解的同时，却阻碍了东亚和解。与对德国纳粹清算问题上表现出的极端坚定的态度相比，对日本战犯处理上的仓促与暧昧充分显示了美国在国际政治中的实用主义态度。在东京审判中，有28人作为甲级战犯被起诉，除病死的3人外，25名军人和政治家分别被判处死刑等刑罚。虽然东京审判也将“9・18事变”后对华侵略列为罪行，但是盟国还是倾向于将甲级战犯限定在“主张对美开战的政治家和军人”。因此，发动“9・18事变”的首谋石垣莞尔没有被列为甲级战犯；在日本侵占中国东北时曾任伪“满洲国”高官、后任东条英机内阁阁僚的岸信介被免于起诉并得到释放等。众所周知，侵略中国的“731部队”在中国东北曾经不断进行人体试验，研究和开发国际法所禁止的细菌武器，“而这些战争罪行却由于达成向美国提供实验数据而被免于追究”。[31]美国之所以这样做，“是因为断定日本战后重建只能依靠亲英美派。再进一步说，豁免昭和天皇的战争责任也有其政治考虑”。[32]<br><br>

　　东京审判在某种程度上伸张了人类正义，也推动了世界重归和平状态的进程，其历史意义毋庸置疑。东京审判的主要缺失是亚洲主体的缺席，[33]关于这一点，约翰・道尔（JohnW.Dower）指出，由11国法官组成的审判组内，只有3名来自亚洲，而其中菲律宾和印度的法官得以出席，也是因为他们所代表的祖国与主导审判的美、英在当时有一种宗主国与殖民地的特殊关系。道尔认为，他们不过是作为摆设的“亚洲人”，那场大战似乎不是发生在亚洲独立主权国家之间的，东京法庭基本上是在无视殖民主义、帝国主义的世界与追诉破坏和平罪和反人道罪的高迈理想之间的矛盾状况下进行的。[34]因此，东京审判不仅未能清算日本的殖民主义历史及其意识形态，反而使其隐蔽起来，这与欧洲对纳粹的清算形成鲜明的对照。这一结果，必然留下反省不足的后遗症。我们看到，战后的日本与其他东亚国家在“和解与民族主义”之间往复徘徊，“历史问题现实化”和“现实问题历史化”已形成恶性循环。<br><br>

　　结语<br><br>

　　未尽的历史反思给东亚和平留下不确定因素，日本意图成为“正常国家”的定位目标不仅尚难以被东亚国家接受，也未必令其盟友美国放心，更何况实现亚洲领导者的政治大国志向。“自朝贡体系崩溃以来，虽然日本一直想主导东亚，但从历史上看，可以说，无论在任何时候，日本都没有成为东亚秩序的核心”[35]，这与日本自身在认知与定位上的误判选择是密不可分的。为了解决自身的国家定位问题，日本仍旧需要重视历史反思，在这一过程中认知自己，并以实际行动坚持走和平发展的道路。笔者希望日本将自己打造成“亚洲的瑞士”，精致、优美并宁静，这样做更有利于日本发挥自身的高科技和环境优势，有利于树立在亚洲的良好形象，有利于实现历史和解。但是，日本似乎并不甘心，瑞士毕竟太小了，而日本是习惯于把自己称为“大日本”的。总之，日本将再次经受自身定位的考验。<br><br>
